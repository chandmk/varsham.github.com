	<p>My grandfather had cancer, and he was at the last stage of it. The doctors could do nothing for him now. On the way to the hospital, to have one last time to see him, in my hand were several photographs, of an iris flower, one of his favorites, and his favorite bird - the Chestnut-sided  Warbler. He told me that he had only seen it once, and that day had been the greatest day of his life. I remember that his green eyes, bright green eyes like mine, lit up like stars when he talked about that warbler. He described it so beautifully, that I could hear it again and again, and let his words wash over me like music. But those days would be over. No, they were already over. Grandfather had leukemia, and I still heard my parents talking worriedly over his condition, but on the night before, when they found out that Grandfather would not live another year, they talked much less, and each word they exchanged carried a heavy weight that even both of them combined could not lift.</p>

<p>At last, we arrived at the hospital, and the pictures in my hand were slightly damp with sweat, and wrinkled because I had been clutching them so hard. I reached for my mother&rsquo;s hand and squeezed it, and when my mother looked down at me, I realized that she was holding back tears. Suddenly, she let go of my hand, and we entered a building. A nurse looked up at us, and when she realized who we were, she led us down long hallways, crowded with other nurses rushing for their posts. And at last, as the nurse held the door open for us, I stood stock-still, staring at the man in the bed, the man that was supposed to be my grandfather but wasn&rsquo;t. It was only when my mother nudged me, and said,  &ldquo;Iris, &rdquo; that I walked towards my grandfather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Iris Magnolia Crescent, &rdquo; he said, savoring my full name.  &ldquo;I picked your name, did you know, Iris? &rdquo; Grandfather had told me that several times before, but I knew better than to say so, and I smiled, and said,  &ldquo;No, Grandfather. &rdquo; Suddenly, I felt a lump form in my throat, and I want to run out of the room and cry, but I can&rsquo;t. I have to stay. I have to stay for Grandfather. I handed the best man in the world the pictures that he had taken and treasured, and he smiled.  &ldquo;That, &rdquo; he said, pointing to the picture of an iris:  &ldquo; &hellip;is an iris. My favorite flower. My favorite granddaughter. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandpa, &rdquo; I said, smiling slightly,  &ldquo;I am your only granddaughter, remember? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you are my favorite. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, an alarm rang, and a nurse rushed in. My mother pushed me out the door, and when I turned to sneak a glance at Grandfather, he was blocked by the nurses, and a wave of shame washed over me, and I did not know why.</p>

<p>The next day, my mother told me:  &ldquo;Your grandfather died yesterday. He was ninety-three years old. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Choking back tears, I replied,  &ldquo;He had a good long life, didn&rsquo;t he? &ldquo;</p>
