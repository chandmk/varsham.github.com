    <p>The Columbian Exchange occurred hundreds of years ago. There were two worlds at that time: The Old World and The New World. The Old World consisted of 3 continents: Europe, Africa, and Asia. The New World consists of 2 continents: North America and South America. These two continents were called the Americas.. When Columbus and future explorers traded items with the Americas that lived in the Americas, this was called the Columbian Exchange.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the Columbian exchange had a negative effect. Firstly, the Old World brought diseases along with them. But the American&rsquo;s immune system could not battle these diseases, but the European&rsquo;s immune system is used to these diseases. As a result, the American&rsquo;s died. Some of the diseases that were spread are the measles, small pox, and influenza. Another name for this disease is the flu.</p>

<p>The New World brought with them sand fleas that can penetrate skin. When they lay eggs under skin, they can cause dangerous infections. These sand fleas can also be called chiggers. Also, rats climbed on the explores ships. when they arrived , they caused infestations to the Americans that lived in the New World. Stated in a book titled The Columbian Exchange, the author wrote that the rats  &ldquo;nearly ate the colonists out of house and home. &ldquo;</p>

<p>The Americans were brutally taken back to the explorer&rsquo;s country. Then, in the country, they were enslaved. The people were exploited. They were forced have Catholic faith. In other words, they were forced to change their cultures and traditions, which was not fair. When the Americans died of the European diseases while they were slaves, the need for workers increased, So Europe took people from Africa to be enslaved and be forced to do the work that the Americans had once had done. Between 8 and 10.5 million people were enslaved to produce tobacco, rice, coffee, and sugar for their masters. This could have sparked the Civil war.</p>

<p>In addition, the explorers also spread the diseases that attacked the llamas and alpacas that were in the New world.</p>

<p>In conclusion, many terrible things happened because of the Columbian Exchange. For Example, some of the things that happend are: The Americans died because of the diseases caught by the explorers, slavery was sparked, the rat infestations attacked the colonists, animals caught diseases also spread by the explorers   and the fleas attacked the explorers. That is why I think the effects of the Columbian Exchange was negative.</p>
