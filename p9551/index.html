My question about this article is about the subtitle “Trump Wants Stricter Rules”. My confusion about these paragraphs is about the temporary ban of Muslims entering the United States. How will temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country help with solving the problem? I say this because members of a violent Islamic group could already be in the United States, disguised. Another reason is that the article says two things about Muslims fleeing from this Islamic group that prove my point: “Many Muslims are trying to escape the violent group, though.">

	<p>Rough Draft – “Clinton and Trump”</p>

<p>My question about this article is about the subtitle “Trump Wants Stricter Rules”. My confusion about these paragraphs is about the temporary ban of Muslims entering the United States. How will temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country help with solving the problem? I say this because members of a violent Islamic group could already be in the United States, disguised. Another reason is that the article says two things about Muslims fleeing from this Islamic group that prove my point: “Many Muslims are trying to escape the violent group, though.” and “They want a safe place to go.” In the second quote, “they” is referring to the Muslims fleeing the Islamic group. If Trump bans Muslims from entering, the refugees will not be safe elsewhere because Europe, another one of the refugees’ safe havens, is trying to stop the refugees from coming. According to the article, the United States are one of the safe places for the refugees, which is why there are so many refugees coming to America. I think that Trump is not only trying to stop the Islamic group, but I also think that he is trying to stop refugees and immigrants from coming to America. Even though too many refugees and immigrants can be a problem, I think that they should be allowed in the United States because everyone deserves a good home.</p>
