	<p>I just could not wait to go to the wonderful adventure that was half explained to about the jewel in India. I think I am going there how it is right now. I climbed out of bed, then I picked up the dolphin, then shrunk, then climbed inside. I climbed through the hole at the bottom. That was when I realized that the crack was closed! I tried to rub around where the crack was and I pushed that part, but nothing budged! I was frantic. I was too scared to scream, so I slid down and wept on the floor. I wish I had not come. I wish that I had not come. I wish&hellip; &hellip; .   I drifted off to sleep. Suddenly, something shook me to awaken. It was a butterfly!  &ldquo;I am the queen of all the butterflies. I can easily go through solids. &rdquo; I stared at the butterfly in wonder. There was something about her that made her look as if she was the fairies friends.  &ldquo;Do you know the Shee fairies? The leader of that is Gwendolyne, &rdquo;  &ldquo;Ah! They are my friends! You are the new fairy aren&rsquo;t you! &rdquo;  &ldquo;Yes! I am! &rdquo; I cheerfully replied. All at once, I was in Ireland.  &ldquo;Thank you! &rdquo; But the strange thing was that I was supposed to be in India. Gwendolyne came up to me.  &ldquo;The adventure would not open up in India. Wow! The witches are already here! Here is the spell book! &rdquo; I caught the book and flipped it to the never-come-back spell.  &ldquo;YUTU! RUHE! DRE! DAS! WEG! THING! RING! FOR! LASTOW! &rdquo; The witches disappeared. But I knew that all my adventures were not over.   I would come across the master of the witches, then other enemies. I was glad that I was realeased from being scared. I climbed into the dolphin and I climbed through the whole that the butterfly made. I went home and wrote in my diary. I was scared, but these adventures are the oppurtunities to show how I can be brave and strong with the small resources we have.</p>
