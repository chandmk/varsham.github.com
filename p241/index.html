	<p>Once, there was a place where people replaced cars. One day there was a car named Doodle that was in that place - the place where cars get replaced.</p>

<p>Doodle was the most tired car! He was ruined because he worked too hard-he had dents on him. So, he had to stay at the car company for 2 weeks. When he was repaired, he went out into the world searching for work merrily and sang,”Let’s be merry, let’s be merry, and ride along the road!” While he sang he laughed happily without a care. He finally found a job! He had to carry people to dentists and doctors, take animals to the vet, and lots of other tedious things. He got tired but kept on working.</p>

<p>But one day, when he was rumbling on a cliff, he saw a pond. Then, his wheels stopped with a JERK! He was being pushed into the pond! But wait, it wasn’t a pond, it was an ocean! 20 minutes later, he was already in the ocean completely. After 5 minutes, the tow truck came along and said,”Hey, Doodle, do you need some help?” He replied weakly,”Yes, sir!” So the kind tow truck pulled Doodle out and they strolled together, side by side, laughing as they went along.</p>
