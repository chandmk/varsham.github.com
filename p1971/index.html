	<p>Hope is Everything</p>

<p>Seawater Beach was beautiful because the waves gently walked along its mushy border -the sand. Alissa, her mother and their dog Buttercup went along the beautiful beach. Alissa decided to make sand castles. Before they could make a sand castle, the waves suddenly rocked ferociously across it&rsquo;s border.</p>

<p>Alissa&rsquo;s dog Buttercup helplessly barked at the long, high, strides of desperate waves. Buttercup yanked the leash out of Alissa&rsquo;s hands and disappeared into the waves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buttercup! Buttercup! Come back! &rdquo; called Alissa. She started crying. They searched for Buttercup everywhere but they could not find her.  &ldquo;Calm down Alissa. We will come back to search for Buttercup. &rdquo; Mother said soothingly.  &ldquo; Buttercup could die in such ferocious waves! &rdquo; cried Alissa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Alissa.  &rdquo; said her mother.  &ldquo;Hope is everything. If you hope, Buttercup will come back to you. &ldquo;</p>

<p>They both kept checking but they could not find their dog, until one day &hellip;</p>

<p>When Alissa&rsquo;s family was home, the doorbell rang. As Alissa opened the door she saw Buttercup being carried by a man. The mother asked how they knew it was their dog.</p>

<p>The person (the person was named Philip) said,  &ldquo;I saw your dog go into the waves but before that, I got a good look at the dog and you. I took a picture of both you and the dog. I saw it wash up the shore very sick. I live in your community. I searched and I saw you in this house. And I brought the dog to you. &rdquo;  &ldquo;Thank you! &rdquo; said the mother. Philip gave Buttercup back to Alissa. She thanked Philip. Alissa said  &ldquo; You were right, Mom. Hope is everything. &rdquo; They both laughed.</p>
