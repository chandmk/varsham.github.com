	<p>At school, I joined a seminar that took place during recess called Saferacer. I learned that Saferacer was all about building a car individually or with a team and competing against other cars from other schools. Another main constraint was that I had to use recyclable materials. I decided that I wanted to join this seminar because I like to build things, and building a car was beyond my imagination. So I immediately joined the seminar Saferacer.</p>

<p>Next we had to decide if we wanted to work individually, or to work with a team to build the car. I decided I wanted to be with a team because I believe in the saying, &ldquo;Two heads are better than one. &rdquo; Next, the people who wanted to be in teams had to pick their teams. I landed in a team of 4 people including me, and then another team member joined afterwards during the period that was set for us to build the car.</p>

<p>Working in a team took a lot of cooperation. We had to each listen to each other&rsquo;s ideas, and then we would have to agree on 1 idea if we disagreed, but finally, we worked our disputes out. We did quite well in the competition. We even won second place out of all of the other school&rsquo;s students that participated! In fact, it turned out to be good that I had wanted to be on a team instead of being an individual!</p>
