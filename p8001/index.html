		<title>Almost Home by Joan Bauer - Varsha</title>

		<meta name="description" content="Almost Home makes me feel as if I had just eaten a warm chocolate. Joan Bauer wrote in a colloquial style, with added a beautiful effect. Written by Joan Bauer, this story touched my heart.
Sugar Mae Cole had a father that she didn&rsquo;t trust. He owed many people, including her grandfather, King Cole. But trouble flares after his death. 12-year-old Sugar Cole loses her home, and her mother shuts down, and Sugar&rsquo;s dreary result was that she was left alone, and she had much to experience.">
