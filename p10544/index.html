	<p>Crack! I hear the crack of the whip from outside, and my mother storms in, her face as red as the bricks on our fireplace. I know to avoid her at times like this, and I dodge the storming feet and the flailing hands, and especially, the whip. I run outside to our beautiful mansion, with a temptation to stop by the endearing little pond next to the mansion, but I resist it with a little regret, because I had many chores to do. I sprint up the enormous stairs, up to my room, just when I hear my mother come in, slamming the door loudly behind her. I grab the messily placed clothes on my bed and begin to fold them,  just as my mother climbs up the stairs, puffing with exertion, and just when the door of my room creaks open, I have yesterday&rsquo;s dress neatly folded. My mother pauses before asking,  &ldquo;Have you almost finished your chores, Felicity? &ldquo;</p>

<p>I stammer,  &ldquo;Yes, Mother, &ldquo;</p>

<p>She leaves, and I sigh, letting out the breath that I had been holding. My mother frightens me, because she could get so very angry, and even my father avoids her then. And Kitty, one of the slaves, is even more frightened of my mother than I am, because she is so young, only nine, and she gets in trouble often, and because she cannot always do what my mother expects of her. My mother expects much from me, too. She carries the principle,  &ldquo;Children should be seen and not heard, &rdquo; so I should follow her and remain  &ldquo;ladylike &ldquo;, obedient and polite, according to my mother.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I hear a sweet little voice, saying quietly,  &ldquo;Miss? &ldquo;</p>

<p>Startled, I whip around, but seeing that it is only Kitty, I relax, and say,  &ldquo;What is it, Kitty? &rdquo; kindly, and it is only now that I realized that it is very late, already past my bedtime.</p>

<p>Her face is tense, and her mouth is set in a firm line.  &ldquo;Mistress, you must come outside, &ldquo;</p>

<p>I have never seen Kitty so tense, so I inch closer to the young girl and whisper,  &ldquo;But I am not allowed. Mother would get awfully angry &hellip; &ldquo;</p>

<p>Kitty&rsquo;s face suddenly reflects despair, silhouetted by the beaming full moon that shines its pale sheen into my room. She says,  &ldquo;But - they&rsquo;re asleep! &ldquo;</p>

<p>Still worried, I whisper to her,  &ldquo;But if they are to wake? &ldquo;</p>

<p>Smiling, Kitty replies,  &ldquo;We will be as quiet as mice. They won&rsquo;t wake. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Hearing a sudden creak, I quickly shush her and cock my head, listening. But it is only the wind whistling through the inevitable cracks in our very old mansion, so I turn back to her, thinking to accept her request in case she was doing something dangerous, and so I reply:  &ldquo;Yes. &ldquo;</p>

<p>I  sneak out of the room, with Kitty close behind, recognizing the familiar feeling of the sanded wood on my feet. Then, suddenly remembering the creaky floorboard in front of my room, in the nick of time, I shoot my hand out,  stopping  Kitty from taking another step. She stifles a small yelp, but otherwise, she does not betray her surprise. I point towards the stairs, and Kitty and I inch towards the steps, and we slowly make our way down, constantly stumbling, with no light except for the gentle, unconcerned light of the moon.</p>

<p>At last, we are at the bottom of the stairs, and it is easy to get out of the house then, but my feet are uncomfortable as we walk down the gravel path that leads out of the front door of our mansion barefoot, with rocks jabbing and gnawing at my poor soft feet every which way, and for a moment, I am tempted to complain, but I do not.</p>

<p>As we continue on that path that constantly attacks my feet, my eyes adjust to the mild darkness,  and I see two other small shapes, about as tall as Kitty. As Kitty and I come closer, I see that the two shapes are one of Kitty&rsquo;s sisters, Geraldine, and Faith, another slave. Confused, I turn to Kitty to ask her why Faith and Geraldine were there, but she shushes me, and she gestures towards them, and still confused, I walk towards them, trying to figure out what is going on.</p>

<p>Then, Geraldine, evidently sensing my confusion and unease, says,  &ldquo;Please. Help us. We -  &ldquo;</p>

<p>She stops, unable to go on, and I see a twinge of fear flicker off her normally impassive face. I say,  &ldquo;Go on, &rdquo; and after a lot of hesitancy, she finishes:  &ldquo;We are running away. &ldquo;</p>

<p>I gasp, unable to process what Geraldine said, and I turn towards the mansion, unsure of what to do with this information. When slaves ran away, if they were found, they could be hobbled, whipped, sold, and even killed. Then, I think of what would happen to me. If I was caught helping these slaves &hellip;</p>

<p>Faith then grabs my arm, desperation filling her voice quickly, like water in a tipping-bucket rain gauge on a stormy day, and she says,  &ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t tell Mistress Edwards! Please, she will -  &ldquo;</p>

<p>In a deep, soft voice that cracks, I says,  &ldquo;I know, she will get very angry &hellip; &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So - will you h-help us? &ldquo;</p>

<p>I wish I refused Kitty&rsquo;s offer of going outside with her, of hearing this information that I did not want to hear. But, mother would get angry, angrier than every before, if she knew that the slaves were trying to run away. And she would inflict her wrath, even more so than she has ever done. She will crush their spirit, and I couldn&rsquo;t let that happen. So, against my mother&rsquo;s principles, I nod.  &ldquo;I will, &rdquo; I say.</p>

<p>I run to my secret stash of candles that I use when I go to the outhouse near the shed. I take one from the carefully concealed satchel that is wedged underneath a loose floorboard in the small space, and I put it in my pocket, and already, after I put back the satchel, I am running like the wind, running as quickly and quietly as I could. At last, I reach the huddled three, and I light the candle with a  spare candle wick that I  always keep in the  deep pockets of my simple pink and white dress, and suddenly, I am holding a beacon of light. I gesture to them, and we all run to the storage room, where all the food would be.</p>

<p>At last, after supplying Faith, Kitty, and Geraldine with enough food to last them for a while, I give them each a hug, and hand the candle to Kitty, and suddenly, like three black cats in a black, black night, they run away from their old, miserable life. Seeing them leave, I know I must part from here, too, so I run back towards the mansion, and I feel my way up the stairs. The gentle moon is hidden by a cloud now, so I don&rsquo;t have as much light, and at last, I crawl in front of my room, and too late, I remember the creaky floorboard. The board creaks loudly, and I hear the shuffle of bedclothes as my mother sits up, definitely coming to see the source of the noise. Adrenaline pumping, I run quickly and quietly into my room, jump into bed, and close my eyes. I hear the loud footsteps of my mother as she walks slowly down the hall, but by then, I am already  &ldquo;asleep &ldquo;. After she walks up to my bed to check if I am sleeping, she sees that my eyes are closed, but thankfully she cannot hear my loud,  racing heartbeat. After what seems like ages, she leaves, walking slowly back to her room, and then, after calming my racing heart, I finally fall asleep.</p>

<p>I wake to the sound of my mother speaking loudly and angrily to my father downstairs.  &ldquo;Well, Charles? Where have they gone?! &ldquo;</p>

<p>My father answers with,  &ldquo;Who do you speak of, Veronica? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young slaves! Faith, Geraldine, and that despicable, despicable, Kitty! &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know, maybe you should ask Felicity. &ldquo;</p>

<p>I  hear her storm out of the room with my father, and she comes up the stairs, loudly, and muttering random things. I jump out of bed and smooth out the dress I slept in, wanting to look innocent and convincing in front of my mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Felicity, where are they? The slaves? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, Mother. &rdquo; Good. Simple is good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they run away? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mother. &rdquo; I see my mother getting even more frustrated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only time for them to run away would be night, wouldn&rsquo;t it, Felicity? &ldquo;</p>

<p>Without waiting for my reply, my mother continues:  &ldquo;Does that explain the creak I heard last night? &ldquo;</p>

<p>I wait, wondering if this question is rhetorical, like the previous question had been, but she stares at me, waiting for an answer, an answer that I give:  &ldquo;Mother, I heard no creak. I was asleep. I didn&rsquo;t even know that you came to my room. &rdquo; As long as I stay polite and ladylike, I can save myself, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

<p>My mother&rsquo;s face twists maliciously:  &ldquo;But, Felicity, dear, how would you know I came to your room last night if you were asleep? Are you lying to me? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no, Mother, &rdquo; I reply quickly, but I know it is of no use. Mother has found a chink in my armor, and I know she will use it to her advantage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have caused that creak. Did you? &ldquo;</p>

<p>I shake my head fervently, but once again, it is not enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You helped them escape, didn&rsquo;t you? &rdquo; Unable to say anything, I stand in front of her, fear flooding me.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, as fast as a cardinal&rsquo;s feathers when it flies, my mother slaps me, and then she walks out of the room, turning her back on me, as I clutch my stinging cheek.  I know I deserve it. Or do I? Is it right to have assisted the runaways? And most important of all, is it right to defy my mother&rsquo;s principles? After thinking for a moment, I realize that I know the answer. If my mother was going to punish me for helping three young girls get away from their life of terror, than the answer to the question I have been asking myself would be yes. It is right, to save another few from this injustice of slavery, despite the painful consequences, which I have endured now. Yes, it is right to follow my own principles, and not just the unsupported claims of others, and to think my own way, and not to think what everyone else thinks, to be unique.</p>
