    <p>I am an orphan. I&rsquo;d rather be alone than be adopted. This is my story. For the beginning, I was adopted. I was 8 years old. I always dreamed of doing ridiculous things. I was a dreamer. Adventurous. I cried on the the first day I lived with my mother and father. I always curled up into a ball and slept in my room. When it was my 9th birthday, I got the courage to say something very sad. I feel ashamed about it now.   I said,  &ldquo;You people are the ugliest, meanest, worst parents everyone could ever imagine! &rdquo; It was true, you had to admit, because they never gave me any presents on my birthdays and they told me to sleep outside when I am to afraid to sleep in my room. I told them why.  &ldquo;You never give me presents, you only let me stay in the house, and you only let me have a brown color in my room.  &rdquo; The tears began to swim in my eyes. Then, I got the crazy idea of running away. I could not push it out. I slammed the door of my room shut. I cried. The next night, I asked to sleep outside. I slept through until 12:00. I wrapped everything I wanted to take in my blanket. Luckily, they let me have a bike. I put the bundle in the back basket. I biked fast to a cottage I had always seen. No one lived in it. I made myself a home in it. I closed the shutters tight. I locked the door shut. I slept a lot. My house had a clock. It was 9:00 when I woke up. I opened my bundle. I packed:</p>

<ol>
<li>water bottles</li>
<li>pillows</li>
<li>My 3 fabric dolls</li>
<li>10 books</li>
<li>The mini computer that I owned</li>
<li>my diary</li>
<li>a ball</li>
<li>A plant I owned</li>
<li>first aid kit</li>
<li>My family photograph</li>
</ol>
