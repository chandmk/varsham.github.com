If I was a superhero, I would want to be able to conjure up anything that I want. I would want to have this ability because then, it would be easy for me to save many lives. Another power I would like is the ability to time travel to any place I want. I would want this power because if I time traveled back to the Revolutionary War, I could save many people from dying.">

<p>If I was a superhero, I would want to be able to conjure up anything that I want. I would want to have this ability because then, it would be easy for me to save many lives. Another power I would like is the ability to time travel to any place I want. I would want this power because if I time traveled back to the Revolutionary War, I could save many people from dying. Also, I would like to be invincible. This could help me from letting anyone harm me. Also, if I combine all the powers I had mentioned so far, I could save lots of people and enjoy myself. Lastly, I would like to have flying power. If I could fly, then I would be able to go anywhere I desire. Some places that I would want to go to would be Ocean City, Myrtle Beach, Florida, and any place with lots of trees that I can climb. Those are the super powers I would have if I was a superhero.</p>
