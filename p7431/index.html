    <p>Annelise lived in a lovely seaside town in Ocean City. Her mother had died a long time ago from a sickness, so Annelise had to stay in this house. She had moved here when she finished her schooling. But she had an ambition: writing.</p>

<p>Her father had built the little house she lived in, and this drew attention to the ones living in the hotels to live in houses of your own. That was how the town of Seasideville was created.</p>

<p>One day the mayor paced back and forth.</p>

<p>“The people are bored!” he said to his friend, the general.</p>

<p>“They want books! I will establish a writing contest for Seasideville and the winner will be an author.”</p>

<p>“Great idea, friend! I will pass out the news using our newspaper.”</p>

<p>So that came to pass.</p>

<p>Annelise was so excited. A writing contest in Seasideville! The first time! Annelise got so excited that she saved up some money and the very next day, she had already bought the writing supplies!</p>

<p>Annelise soon went about mending a dress for herself and she tidied the house as if she was going to get guests.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, outside, a group of workers were moving things into the house next door. Annelise looked out of the window and saw the new neighbors. She recognized them immediately!</p>

<p>They were bullies from school. She had been teased because she was small and smart. Annelise closed everything so that the bullies wouldn’t see her. This made the room quite dark, so she lit an oil lamp and continued mending her dress. Weeks passed, and the bullies soon came to know about Seasideville’s writing contest. They started mending their dresses and even used some of Annelise’s help. But, they didn’t bother to say thank you at all.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, an earthquake struck while Annelise was outside. She saw the old house that her father built teeter, then fall. Annelise burst into tears and sank into a soaking heap.</p>

<p>After Annelise’s tears had subsided, the bullies tricked Annelise into getting into living in their house. But they treated her badly. Annelise felt terrible, but also felt it wise to keep quiet about it.</p>

<p>Finally, the writing night had arrived. The two bullies dressed into fancy dresses and even had a decorated binder to put their piece in. As they walked away, tossing their heads about and telling all sorts of things, Annelise was sad. She sat down on the shore, the water lapping at her feet. The water was warm and comforting.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a bird swooped out. It was a cardinal! Cardinals in Ocean City? The cardinal sang a high-pitched song that went:</p>

<p>Annelise, Full of kindness</p>

<p>Annelise, We will help you</p>

<p>If it so please you.</p>

<p>“How will you help me?” asked Annelise. Her head started to spin. The cardinal chirped a high note which changed the old dress that Annelise was mending. It was now a beautiful green dress, with real emerald jewels and emerald slippers included.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a frog hopped into the bullies’ house, returned with writing supplies, and he flattened himself out before the confused girl to serve as a desk. The bird sang words to her, and then in no time Annelise had created a perfect writing piece. Annelise smiled and thanked them. But before Annelise could walk away the bird had flew in front of her. “You have to return right after you read the piece because the dress will fall off if you don’t and you will only be dressed in your rags, and your emerald slippers will be replaced by your bare feet. ” Annelise promised.</p>

<p>When Annelise arrived, she was the last person to take the last slot left in the contestant list. Everyone went until it was time for Annelise to read her story. Everyone loved it, especially the mayor. But what took him by surprise was that she had ran off right after the piece. The mayor tried going after her but she was too fast for him. He sadly sat down, deep in thought of how to get that girl who wrote that beautiful piece. Then, a bell went off in his head! The mayor told everyone that did the contest to enter their name and their piece in his website. Annelise entered because the mayor made a threat accompanied with the command.</p>

<p>Then, the next day, the mayor checked his website. As soon as he saw the first word of Annelise’s piece he knew her name. The mayor asked everyone where Annelise lived, and she was eventually found. Annelise had finally met her ambition: writing.</p>
