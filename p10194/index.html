	<p>I really liked  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Eggs</span>, a book about a boy who lost his mother, but changes when he gains a new friend.</p>

<p>At first, David seemed so disagreeable, but later, because of Spinelli&rsquo;s ability to keep a question of  &ldquo;Why? &rdquo; pulsing through our mind, I found out that David was only disagreeable because he had lost his mother in a way that felt like a punch in the gut. The pain lasted for days. But then, when he meets Primrose, he changes. Primrose is a carefree girl with a  &ldquo;crackpot &rdquo; mother, who is somewhat disagreeable, and she loves pretending. For instance, she pretended to be a dead body, and in another scene, she pretended to be David&rsquo;s mother. They are VERY unlikely pair, because Primrose is almost as disagreeable as David, and so I was surprised that they got along(sometimes). Jerry Spinelli concocted this great story that is really unique, or, in other words, unlike any other.</p>
