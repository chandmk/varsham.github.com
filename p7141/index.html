    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">CLARENCE</span></p>

<p>Clarence hovered over her studies, her experiments. She was a robotics scientist.</p>

<p>Suddenly she had an idea.</p>

<p>It would be the greatest one yet.</p>

<p>Her project.</p>

<p>In a matter of minutes, Clarence had created her life long dream.</p>

<p>The robot moved and waved his hand.  &ldquo;Hi. &ldquo;</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">BRONCHUS(BROHN-KUS)  </span><em>Centuries later &hellip; &hellip;.</em></p>

<p>He was a robot. He was named Bronchus.</p>

<p>Bronchus turned to a Canadian robot and asked him to ring the bell. The bell told the robots when there was an announcement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fellow robots! &ldquo;</p>

<p>Bronchus&rsquo;s voice projected into the small, robot-sized, microphone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to commit a plot of revenge. &ldquo;</p>

<p>In his mind, he knew what the revenge was.</p>

<p>The robots gasped.</p>

<p>One Mexican robot whispered to another Mexican robot, &ldquo;Revenge? How does King Bronchus know what the revenge would be, after what they have done to us? They have done something beyond measure, That even the samurai robots cannot master! &ldquo;</p>

<p>This started the murmuring. It grew louder and louder until -</p>

<p>&ldquo;SILENCE!! &ldquo;</p>

<p>The robots were so startled. They looked down guiltily at the floor, as if all of a sudden, they were prisoners proven guilty.</p>

<p>Bronchus leaned back in the chair that Thwaites, the same Canadian robot from the beginning had put for him. Thwaites was Bronchus&rsquo;s only living relative.</p>

<p>This project must be the world greatest yet.</p>

<p>It would be The Project.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">CLARENCE</span></p>

<p>That factory.</p>

<p>It opened up a long time ago, perhaps more than a century ago.</p>

<p>A robot-destroying factory.</p>

<p>It was called  <em><span style="color: #ff0000">Away with Mechanics.</span></em></p>

<p>Written in the same red color.</p>

<p>What if Bronchus got it?</p>

<p>He would be smashed to bits.</p>

<p>That factory was so pathetic.</p>

<p>Poor Bronchus.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">BRONCHUS</span></p>

<p>Thwaites looked worriedly at his father Bronchus, who was sitting down in his small comfortable chair, deep in thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is wrong with majesty sir? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get Barbel, Thwaites. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But- &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I SAID GET BARBEL, THWAITES! &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your Majesty says so. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Thwaites said with fright.</p>

<p>He quickly walked away, leaving the room to silence.</p>

<p>_<span style="color: #ff0000">Away With Mechanics </span>_had already wiped out many of the French robots, including his dearest friend, Narvil.</p>

<p>He spoke of Napolean all the time but King Bronchus (As everyone called him for he was the robot leader) loved to listen to all this.</p>

<p>But the day Narvil left &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip;.</p>

<p>His eyes filled with tears thinking of this.</p>

<p>Bronchus quickly wiped the tears away when he saw Thwaites arriving with Barbel.</p>

<p>Barbel was a   robot from Thailand that Bronchus appointed as a samurai robot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;King, Thailand is in big trouble, please let me go to them! &ldquo;</p>

<p>Barbel struggled under Thwaites&rsquo;s hard grip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chill Barbel. We are going to go there to commit my revenge. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Thailand do sir? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They set up that robot destroying factory an put it in Slovakia!! &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go to Slovakia then, instead? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thailand first, and that&rsquo;s that. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, THwaites, let me go! &ldquo;</p>

<p>Thwaites had tightened his grip on Barbel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why have you called me, sir? &rdquo; said Barbel, still struggling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are coming with us. &rdquo; THwaites said confidently.</p>

<p>He dragged him over to the King who put a sleeping potion on Barbel and carried him to the country portal.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">CLARENCE</span></p>

<p>Clarence wondered what happened.</p>

<p>She couldn&rsquo;t stop that factory.</p>

<p>Why were they doing this?</p>

<p>Clarence had to find out.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">BRONCHUS</span></p>

<p>Barbel woke up as soon as they arrived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we in Thailand? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh, I should have put a long-term sleeping potion on you. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Instead, The king sprayed Barbel with mute potion.</p>

<p>Barbel quieted.</p>

<p>For the first time, Bronchus saw Thailand.</p>

<p>For a second, Bronchus was speechless.</p>

<p>Then he came back to his usual imperious/cruel way.</p>

<p>Barbel still was so mute.</p>

<p>Then Barbel saw a great friend. Bronchus quickly sprayed him again so he could talk to his friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello! &ldquo;</p>

<p>And that was all.</p>

<p>Then, King Bronchus raised his hand.</p>

<p>Thwaites was very afraid.</p>

<p>The ocean lunged forward.</p>

<p>Bronchus had created a tsunami.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">CLARENCE</span></p>

<p>Clarence knew all the facts.</p>

<p>She knew that the factory was in Slovakia.</p>

<p>Clarence typed the factory&rsquo;s name, and then stepped in the portal that she had made.</p>

<p>She was now in Slovakia.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">BRONCHUS</span></p>

<p>Thwaites felt Barbel trying to lunge forward, but he kept his grip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let go of him, Thwaites. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Thwaites slowly let go of the samurai.</p>

<p>Barbel lunged forward.</p>

<p>Bronchus sprayed him again and Barbel was not mute anymore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wanted to go to Thailand so I sent him to Thailand. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty? I have a question. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, son? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he turn into a human when he goes to Thailand? &ldquo;</p>

<p>The king smiled down at Thwaites.</p>

<p>His long-lost son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thwaites, The robots all turn into human when they go into any country with people in it. My son, I will tell you how you were born. You are 13 years old and you are old enough. &ldquo;</p>

<ol>
<li>Thwaites&rsquo;s Birth</li>
</ol>

<p>Latvia, Bronchus&rsquo;s wife had given birth to a beautiful baby robot. Suddenly, the next day, he saw a note. He found out that his wife and baby robot was kidnapped.</p>

<p>Bronchus had searched all over the place.</p>

<p>He then gave himself a good long cry.</p>

<p>Then, he saw a young woman and a baby robot on his ddor step.</p>

<p>Latvia was on his doorstep.</p>

<p>She was dead.</p>

<p>But the baby wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Bronchus named the Baby robot Thwaites, meaning Wonder in roboat language.</p>

<p>♣  ♣  ♣  ♣  ♣  ♣  ♣  ♣  ♣</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the story of your birth, Thwaites. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for telling me, father. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Bronchus&rsquo;s messenger bee flew over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Dewdrop? &rdquo; said Bronchus, lovingly stroking the bees wings.</p>

<p>Dewdrop dropped the message his lap and flew off.</p>

<p>The message told him that   there was trouble in Greenland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go! &rdquo; cried Thwaites.</p>

<p>They stepped in to the country portal and were gone.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">CLARENCE</span></p>

<p>Clarence arrived at Slovakia. She looked around for the robot-destroying factory.</p>

<p>Clarence glanced at her GPS and saw she was going in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Then she looked at the amount of charging.</p>

<p>She saw that there was 7% left.</p>

<p>Clarence was lost.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">BRONCHUS</span></p>

<p>They arrived right next to the tall, ice capped, mountains.</p>

<p>Thwaites shivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it is cold, Thwaites. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Thwaites smiled gratefully at his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what the trouble is, son. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Check back at Dewdrop&rsquo;s note father. It might tell us. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Bronchus opened the folded note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not there, but thanks for the suggestion. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must explore out then, &rdquo; said Thwaites.</p>

<p>They went to the southern side of Greenland.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">CLARENCE</span></p>

<p>Clarence was afraid.</p>

<p>What should she do?</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Her GPS was dead in power.</p>

<p>She looked around warily.</p>

<p>She looked this way and that.</p>

<p>The factory was probably far, far, away.</p>

<p>Clarence stepped into the country portal.</p>

<p>She transported herself to her laboratory.</p>

<p>There had to be some other way.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">BRONCHUS</span></p>

<p>The southern side of Greenland had tall grassy hills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that Greenland would be cold everywhere, but I guess I was wrong, Thwaites. &rdquo; Bronchus said, chuckling.</p>

<p>Thwaites said nothing to this.</p>

<p>Bronchus knew that his son was deeply in thought, so he did not say a word.</p>

<p>The silence sustained as father and son looked for the trouble.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he saw something.</p>

<p>A clump of his own robot kind!</p>

<p>They were Welsh robots disobeying their own king!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">CLARENCE</span></p>

<p>Clarence felt as if she was a disgrace to her own robot.</p>

<p>He was crushed already.</p>

<p>Even though the robot was gone, she still have to save the other robots.</p>

<p>I know, reader that you know she is wrong.</p>

<p>Bronchus, her robot is not dead.</p>

<p>He is going around commiting his revenge.</p>

<p>Until a bunch of Welsh robots knocks his socks off.</p>

<p>In a bad way.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">BRONCHUS</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you disobey your own king! &rdquo; bellowed Bronchus.  &ldquo;I sent you to France and here you are in Greenland, snoozing about! &rdquo; Then, his voice became more soft and dangerous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You thought that you were the king didn&rsquo;t you? Oh yes, you wanted to be king.</p>

<p>Do you want to be a samurai and face the same pain as Barbel? &ldquo; There was a malicious twinkle to his eye and a malicious smile tugging at his lips.</p>

<p>The Welsh robots paid no attention to him.</p>

<p>The king sent bursts of wind that made them fly all the way to France.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&rsquo;t come back until you are done! &ldquo; yelled Bronchus, with a malicious laugh.</p>

<p>Now, reader you must feel bad for Thwaites. No?</p>

<p>Would you like it if you had to watch gruesome things like that?</p>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s your choice if you don&rsquo;t want to put yourself in Thwaites shoes.</p>

<p>Thwaites was feeling very uncomfortable at this point, and you don&rsquo;t know how badly Thwaites wanted to tell his dad.</p>

<p>But Thwaites was afraid.</p>

<p>What if his father did the same things that he watched him do to others to Thwaites?</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t want that, so he decided to hold his tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the trouble there in Greenland. Thank goodness to Dewdrop. &rdquo; The father smiled at his son.</p>

<p>The two headed out for a vacation on the Big Island in Hawai&rsquo;i.</p>
