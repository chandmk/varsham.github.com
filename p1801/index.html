	<p>The Greenlawn community set up a baseball game, to help the kids with special needs in camp challenge.When the game was going on, the baseballs signed by Babe Ruth were stolen!They suspected Pete the Umpire who got allergy and went in the club house to get his medicine.Everyone was wondering about the baseballs until the kids saw that Pete was arrested. Officer told Josh, Dink, Ruth Rose that Pete confessed, that he stole the base balls.But he is not telling where the baseballs were.The kids looked on the internet about Pete Unkenholz. Then, the kids found out that Pete stole a van in Maine.Dink, Josh, Ruth Rose went to Petes trailer home and saw his medicine box in the trash can outside. The kids went to the police station to convince Pete to talk to his Lawyer because they believed in him. Again they went to the trailer home, they found Buddy (Pete&rsquo;s brother). Buddy told them that his brother Pete, was thinking that Buddy stole the a baseballs and Pete wanted to cover his brother. Dink, Josh, and Ruth Rose got an idea of looking in the website YUBUY.com to see if the thief put the baseballs for auction. They emailed the person who was trying to sell the baseballs and he replied with his name and address. Finally Officer Fallon caught the thief and the game could start again.</p>
