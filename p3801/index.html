	<p>Anna went outside and climbed the tree. She did not see Caroline. Anna looked around for her. She was worried that Caroline might be trapped with the aliens again. Suddenly, Caroline tumbled down from the tree. Anna was frightened from the fall of her friend, even though she had a cushion under her wings. But Caroline was giggling madly as she stood up on her feet. Anna couldn&rsquo;t stop giggling too!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caroline, What should I do? &rdquo; asked Anna. But before Caroline could answer, a Fire sheet burst beneath Anna. Anna dodged the Fire sheet. She made an Ice sheet to press it down and melt it.  &ldquo;Anna, these come everyday. Bring your sister to become an Ice Fairy. There is supposed to be two of every fairy. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Anna climbed down the tree and was thinking about how to convince her sister to come to Fairyland. Anna saw her sister Bethany playing in the backyard.  &ldquo;Bethany, don&rsquo;t get frightened. You need to listen calmly. &rdquo; Bethany was scared of many things, Anna didn&rsquo;t want to frighten her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know that fairies are real? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silly Anna! Fairies aren&rsquo;t real. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will prove it. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;OK &ldquo;</p>

<p>Anna led Bethany up the tree. As soon as Bethany saw Caroline, she had this surprise look on her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bethany, Bethany, Don&rsquo;t be scared. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not. I am surprised. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never notice that you are shrinking. &rdquo; said Anna</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are. You are becoming a fairy. &rdquo; said Caroline.</p>

<p>Bethany had a big amount of curiosity. She started asking many questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do I have a bracelet? What should I do with it? Why is it made out of snow? Why do I have a wand? What should I do with that?</p>

<p>Why did I shrink? Why is my wand made out of snowflakes? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caroline, could you answer all these questions? &rdquo; asked Anna.</p>

<p>Anna was sometimes annoyed by Bethany&rsquo;s questions. Especially this time.</p>

<p>Caroline sighed and said, &ldquo;You are a Fairy now Bethany.Being an Ice Fairy makes you need to have Ice and snow near you. I will tell you when your adventure comes up. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! But what is my adventure? &ldquo;</p>

<p>Bethany&rsquo;s curiosity grew worse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will tell you. &rdquo; said Caroline.</p>

<p>Anna was happy that Bethany became an Ice Fairy. The two girls happily skipped home, feeling very refreshed.</p>
