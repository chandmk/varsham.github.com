    <p>Kids are recommended to sleep for 8 hours. If kids stay awake all night, they will have many negative effects mentally and physically.</p>

<p>Firstly, kids won&rsquo;t be able to focus in school work. Secondly, they will be more prone to sickness. During our slumber, the body is put at rest so that it is able to function the next day and so forth. Kids don&rsquo;t get that rest, the immune system will be working overtime and might get tired of fighting bacteria. Then, it could let really bad viruses slip through. Same thing could happen with the brain. The brain will be so tired and it will also be working overtime. It could get tired, and when that happens you can lose control of your emotions. Then, you could be sad or angry all the time.</p>

<p>Did you know that a chemical in your brain forms when you are happy? The chemical is actually good for you, So being happy is good for you! When stress comes in the brain, the brain makes less and less of that chemical and it could effect all of the systems in your body. Like how the Tin Man of Wizard of Oz needs oil to help it move, your body also needs that  &ldquo;oil. &rdquo; That is why it is so <span style="color: #00ff00">IMPORTANT</span> to get enough sleep!</p>

<p><span style="color: #33cccc">Remember to sleep at 9:00-9:30 when you want to be healthy!</span></p>
