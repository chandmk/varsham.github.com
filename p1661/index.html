    <p>1 heard a constant  &ldquo;thud, thud &rdquo; coming from the number 0.</p>

<p>1 said to 2, &ldquo; 0 does not belong here, he belongs to the negatives. Let&rsquo;s throw him out of our group. Pass this message along to the other numbers, 2. &ldquo;</p>

<p>So, the message went on until 10.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right 1, let&rsquo;s do it! YAHOO! &rdquo; 10 said to 1.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So throw him out  of this group! He is the leader of the negatives! Don&rsquo;t be late! &rdquo; So they put 0 out of their group, in a very mean and teasing way.</p>

<p>In the night, 10 slept with no good feelings about 0. He was happy that 0 was out of their group, 10 and his crew also thought that 0 was the leader of the negatives, but he was in the 1 to 10 group. The next morning, every number was shocked. 10 became 1! All because 10 needed 0 to become 10. 10 called for 0 and asked him, &ldquo; Why am I 1, not 10? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a 1 because 10 has a 0, which is me, and without any 0, there is no 10. &rdquo;  &ldquo;How bad we were when we threw you out of our group. Please stay with us. &rdquo;  &ldquo;The negatives want me and you want me, so we can share each other. &ldquo;Thank You! &rdquo; cried out 10. Since then, 0 came to be in the middle of the negatives and the positives.</p>
