	<p>I grunt, I cry. There cannot be any solution. Could there just be one? There could if I stopped, there could if I stopped all unintelligible talks with comforting parents. Could I just show that I would stop? This should be comforting if iâ€™d stop. Parents should not here small peels(cries) from me. Should I be positive or negative? POSITIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Parents love their sons or daughters if there is a lot of cooperation. Lets always be pleasant and peaceful, include happiness too! Letâ€™s not be any brutes here. Let us just learn and talk pleasantly and if Iâ€™d did, then that would be much better, than before. Shall we just talk and not kick or scream or cry? We could if Iâ€™d stopped, all unintelligible talks. We could go to a room and talk private.</p>

<p>But why donâ€™t we spend time with each other? Everybody is busy and thatâ€™s the baddest part for kids. Canâ€™t we always spend time with each other?</p>

<p>Dads or moms can be busy all the time by always working with things in the computer. Kids love parents who spend time with them. Why canâ€™t we write mean notes to the people or family? We canâ€™t because it will hurt feelings. Well for kids like me, it is not fair. I have to spend time only few times with my parents!Â Kids need to understand that my mom or dad is working. I should do something else.Â Not only being peaceful is right, LISTENING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is important than anything we have to learn in our house. It is important because listening depends on fighting. So just listen. Be alert and donâ€™t be clumsy about your chores. If your mother says what you donâ€™t expect about playing then control your feelings.Â Just cry if there is a big bleeding scratch. Now should we be independent when you are almost 7 years old? YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You are old enough to do stuff. If you have energy, use it up! Do not have a habit of being with your parents all the time because you are going to be an adult and you have to be</p>
