	<p>Summer of the Swans is a book with very happy ending. I loved this book because when the second-most main character got lost in the woods, the tension of panic rose.</p>

<p>Summary:After Sara had taken Charlie, her mentally handicapped brother, to see the swans nearby, he fell in love with them. During the night, he was itching to go to the swans but he did not know the way, so he got lost. Sara and her Aunt Willie realize this when they found his bed empty. Sara is surprised when she finds that Joe Melby, the one boy from her school that she thought saw steal Charlie&rsquo;s favorite watch, who wants to help. There is one thing main for Sara that makes her worried: Where exactly was her beloved ten-year-old brother?</p>

<p>The way Miss Byars explained this long list of eventful adventure was beautiful. Even though it had a simple plot, there was a lot of feeling and emotion that Sara and Charlie felt beneath the lines.</p>
