    <p><em>Wednsday, October 15, 2014</em>  <strong>CLOVERLAND   UNDER TOTAL DESTRUCTION</strong></p>

<p>Cloverland has been air-raided by enemies. The land&rsquo;s pretty features were deleted from vision. The residents are in dilemma. Queen Kate isn&rsquo;t helping. Queen Athena was busy in her land, so the residents are mystified by the crude behavior of the queen. The queen was not appeared to adopt the land since Queen Athena gave her land. The residents are begging Athena for a solution, but Athena is afraid. The queen of Gittle is mentally wounded by the fact that she has to rule all lands. The poor bedraggled residents are forced to leave the land. The destruction was very terrifying.</p>

<p><strong>GITTLE ENDANGERED BY HUMANS</strong></p>

<p>Human&rsquo;s campfire was discovered in the edge of this land. The residents are worried and afraid of being raided by this species. Gittle scientists have used scientific reasons to see if Gittle is endangered by human litter. Unfortunately, they were right. Queen Athena is scared of turning into a human and keeping the humans from littering their pretty features. Athena&rsquo;s only solution is to ask her sister.</p>
