title: My Experience Of Serving the Community
---

Helping other people is a wonderful thing, and it can teach you life-long lessons. Martin Luther King Jr. quoted, "True peace is not merely the absence of tension: it is the presence of justice." It was an amazing quote because he wanted to convey the importance of equal rights for all. Because he had a dream to diminish all discrimination from the world, hundreds of people helped to serve the community in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. 

My mother and I were interested in helping the poor and the struggling, so we went to the food bank and sorted foods. It was hard work, but the thing that kept me going was that someone would benefit from the work I did. I felt as if I were not alone, and the community would have to work together to make a difference. I knew that without any of the volunteers' help, the work would have not been completed as fast. 

After that, we went to the Days End Farm to clean out the farm animals' stables. Days End was a farm that took horses that needed treatment, and helped them to grow. Sometimes it would take months to heal the horses. We were volunteering to muck, or remove the manure from the stables. It was terrifying; the cold seemed as if it had turned against us. Having no gloves, my mother and I struggled to keep our gelid hands on the pitchforks and dig. I tried, but it was of no use. As I stood, defeated, I thought of the mountain Eiger. Recently I had seen a movie about mountain climbers Toni Kurz and Andi Hinterstoisser. They had attempted to climb the Eiger, only in vain. The temperatures were many degrees below zero, and the avalanches were powerful and destructive. If 37 degrees was cold, who knows how cold 60 degrees below that is?

The Days End Farm volunteering was an experience like never before. People might believe traveling 30 minutes and suffering terrifying cold just for cleaning manure is a demented idea, but it was for animals in need. The food bank was a way to make me feel good that I was making a difference in the community. From this experience, I learned that I shouldn't take for granted what I have, and helping others in need already makes me a winner.
