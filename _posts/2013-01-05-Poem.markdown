                               M y Poem
                I always want to improve
                 when I always not sooth
                 when I waste a lot of food
               in my very grumpy mood
               I always like to play
               and thats what I say everyday.
My mom gives me math,
My mom gives me reading
and I never do seeding,I improve every time I should give lime and I help my mom when ever I can.
