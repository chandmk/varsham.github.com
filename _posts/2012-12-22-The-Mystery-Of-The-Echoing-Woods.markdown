title:The Mystery Of The  Echoing Woods  

CHAPTER 1
One day there was a little boy named Jaylen.
 Jaylen lived in China near the Big Woods.
One cold night, there was some echoing sound.
 It sounded like an animal was answering another animal.
Jaylen knew that people were wondering about who were making those sounds that were coming from the Woods. 

He also wanted to know who were making the sounds, like how the people of China wondered. 
The sounds from the woods were making him wake up all the time.
When that happened, he would always say to himself, "I feel like stopping this noise.
I will wake up this morning and try to stop it. " 
But he could not remember the next day to stop the noise.

One day he went up to his mother and said, "Mother, can I go out and see what that strange noise is?"
"Well, that would be helpful, my son. You are permitted to go," his mother said.
So Jaylen obviously went.
He knew that he had the answer in his heart.

CHAPTER 2
Jaylen went out into the bright woods. He was anxious about the creatures and that they might be scary. 
But he went in anyway. 
When Jaylen got to the place, he looked everywhere.
He looked for a long time. 
Finally, he found the answer. 
A python, leopard, and a cheetah were making the odd noises.
He knew it because they were making the same sounds that he heard the night before and he was delighted when he found the answer.
He was actually right!

CHAPTER 3
Jaylen skipped all the way home, as he brought the wild and friendly animals home. He thought about how delighting it would be if someone got the answer of a mystery. 
Then, when Jaylen was home, he called the zoo keepers, and they came to take the python,leopard, and cheetah away. 
They put them in their zoo. 
"And one more thing," Jaylen's mother asked, "Did you solve the problem, my son?" 
Jaylen grinned and said, "YES!"
From then on, the nights were pleasant and peaceful in all of China.

 CHAPTER 4
Jaylen became very famous, that he spread all over China on newspapers.
He became a famous detective engineer.
