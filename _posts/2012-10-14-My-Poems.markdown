title: My Poems
---


In the bright sunlight there were birds flying
overhead and with the moonlight the owls
spread their wings gracefully.

I am I,I never change but my life does change.
I sometimes change and the feeling in me changes.


My feeling is the poet,and now I feel relaxing the 
relaxing feeling could change into a angry feeling,
whatever I do,whatever I help,my feelings keep
changing.


When I walk past the breeze I can feel my hair
rise up and catch the wind.The trees and the 
flowers make me shiver just because of the
beautiful colors shining in the sunlight.
