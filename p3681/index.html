	<p>Anna was in fairyland and she saw a sign that said spin around 3 times. Anna spun then she saw Egropestel&rsquo;s aliens. Anna threw ice flowers at the aliens. One of the aliens died. An alien said. &ldquo;We will get your friend Caroline and you will never see her! &rdquo; Anna was led to a room where Caroline was strung with heavy twine. The ropes were suffocating her. Also, Anna realized the room (which was all made of heat) had ice tracks from her feet. Anna made a good box for Caroline as she made an ice Tsunami. Anna also added some ice flowers and put them in the flood. All the aliens died with a wail and Anna destroyed the twine.</p>

<p>Anna said,  &ldquo;I wish I could go to Fairyland. &rdquo; Anna knew it would happen because she had said it on her ice adventure MARMALADE and it worked. She instantly appeared back in Fairyland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for saving me, First they got me and almost got Savannah, then they strung me with twine and it so SUFFOCATING ME. Thank you &ldquo;</p>
