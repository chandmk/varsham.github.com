	<p>Hi. I’m Sediment. I used to sit for a long time on this big tall pointy thing. My brothers and sisters have been cruelly taken by…Wind! I’ve been tossed around a lot by him, and believe me, you would NOT like it. It’s like being in those flying things that go around in the air all the time, except you are being roughhoused. Right now I am relaxing on a bunch of other sediment people. They really want to talk, but I just roll over and think about my adventure…</p>

<p>One day, Wind rushed right up to me. Without even calling my flight number, 47, he grabbed me in his cold grip and tossed me around in his hand. I struggled to get back to my precious tall home, but Wind was relentless. He gave no mercy! I then heard him mutter, “Better go get that other sediment I see there.” At last, not taking his eyes off of the sediment he spotted, he opened his hand and I dropped. Into something very cold and disagreeable. I realized who this was. River! I sank slowly in the water. I saw other sediment there. I figured I would never get to see any other sediment in the next place I landed, so I talked to them. They weren’t at all that nice, so I turned away. Suddenly, River began to pull me up from the sediment bottom. Nevertheless of my powerful struggle (for a sediment) River pulled me off the bottom. My next stopping point was in a huge clump of sediment. Suddenly, River began to rise. A natural disaster! I read all about it in sediment school. Flood was overtaking River! Sediment like me can make the river flood. As River flooded, I landed on the other sediment. I am so exhausted &hellip;zzzzzzzzz</p>
