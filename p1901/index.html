	<p>Dink, Josh and Ruth Rose were going to Costra(Yellow Yatcht) because their friend Sammi invited them to his birthday party. Sami showed his friends their room. Suddenly when Dink was choosing a room he saw a strange man peeking out of one room. They all went outside to explore the beech. Dink saw a yellow yacht with the green stripes just above the waterline. Then they heard an alarm sound from the bank. They heard that there was robbery. Sami&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s gold bars he used to pay the aquarium were gone. A tunnel was just behind the artificial boulders they used in the aquarium. The tunnel led to the bank. Dink, Josh, Ruth Rose and Sammi found a crumpled note, that said DUMP THE GOLD OVERTHE WEST WALL AND SOMEONE WILL TAKE THE GOLD AWAY. All the children were suspicious and wondered about the note. They suspected Lees Baz and Riko, the foreman of the aquarium. They finally went and checked the west wall for gold. But they discovered that there were gold scrapings (dents) on the back hoe. Also there were tire marks on the ground near the wall. Also they saw crushed weeds on the other side of the wall. They thought something heavy was dropped down there, like gold. They all went diving with Hugo, a friend of Sami. Then Dink noticed that the real ship Sundown (Hugo led the kids to a replica of the Sundown) sunk and was weighing down by Sami&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s gold!!!. They suspected Dr. Skor, because he is captain of the ship. The kids figured out that Dr.skor was the one behind the robbery with his crew. Dr.Skore was a friend of the Sammi&rsquo;s father. Dr. Skor knew about the gold. Hugo and the kids caught Dr.Skor from escaping.</p>
