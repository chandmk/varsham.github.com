<li><p>Meanwhile, a couple of tricksters got a mace and hid it under a girl’s dress. Then they asked a guru(a knowledgable person) what would the baby be: a girl or a boy? The guru detected that the “baby” was actually a mace, and told the boys furiously to mash up the mace into pieces. There was a piece that couldn’t be pounded, so they threw it in as it was. The piece was swallowed by a fish, and the fish was caught by a fisherman. Finding the piece of iron in the fish, he fitted the iron head onto an empty arrow. This arrow was used to kill the virtuous Vishnu, for the fisherman mistaked his foot for a fish.</p></li>
