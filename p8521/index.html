    <p>First, one defense is the skin. It keeps the germs from attacking the body organs. There is one way that germs can pass through the skin: If there is an open cut in the skin, the germs have a way to the body and making you sick.</p>

<p>Earwax is the 2nd body defense. It is in everyone&rsquo;s ears to trap the germs who try to get the ear, trying to damage the delicate organs in the ear. It is rare that germs get through the earwax stage.</p>

<p>At the same time, mucus and cilia are both working together. When mucus traps the germs that try to get in the body through the nose, the cilia take the germs on its hairs and it waves it. When you feel a tickle in your nose, That means that the cilia is waving itself. Why is this important? Because you can sneeze the bad bacteria and viruses that try to make you sick. The cilia and the mucus are the 3rd and 4th body defense.</p>

<p>If the germs can get through the 4 body defenses that I have covered so far, they come to the amazing stomach acid. Stomach acid can be used to <strong>disintegrate</strong> food that comes through the <strong>esophagus</strong>.   The stomach acid can disintegrate germs. But some germs can get through stomach acid. Then, the immune system goes to work. It acts as an army. The  &ldquo;soldiers &rdquo; are <strong>lymphocytes</strong>. The lymphocytes eat the germs up. That is why your body usually wins over a sickness! Now &hellip;ISN&rsquo;T THAT COOL!!!!!</p>

<p>Glossary:</p>

<p>Disintegrate: (Dis-in-ti-great)To break down into small pieces</p>

<p>Esophagus: (ES-AH-fa-gus)The pipe where food-sometimes germs-goes your stomach after you swallow it.</p>

<p>Lymphocytes:(Lim-Fow-Sites)White blood cells.</p>
