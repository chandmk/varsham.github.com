      <description>I just could not wait to go to the wonderful adventure that was half explained to about the jewel in India. I think I am going there how it is right now. I climbed out of bed, then I picked up the dolphin, then shrunk, then climbed inside. I climbed through the hole at the bottom. That was when I realized that the crack was closed! I tried to rub around where the crack was and I pushed that part, but nothing budged!</description>
