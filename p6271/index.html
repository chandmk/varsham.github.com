They what the correct decision was all the time. Katherine relied on themin her past years. Katherine climbed up on her broom and chanted the enchanted spell to make the broom take her o school. several minutes flew by. Katherine&rsquo;s long auburn hair whipped her face i the fast movement of the wind. finally, she stepped off her broom. But instead of the doors wide open, she saw millions of the guards blocking the entrance streched for miles and miles. Katherine heard the guards saaying, &ldquo;It is ton safe here. go back home! &rdquo; Katherine came over the guards.  &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t I see if anyone is on th other side? I could stop them, &rdquo; said Katherine.  &ldquo;Fine with uss, they said. Katherine flew above on her magic flying broo She fluttered high above the guard</p>
