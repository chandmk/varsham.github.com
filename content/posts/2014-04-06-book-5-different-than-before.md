I just could not wait to go to the wonderful adventure that was half explained to about the jewel in India. I think I am going there how it is right now. I climbed out of bed, then I picked up the dolphin, then shrunk, then climbed inside. I climbed through the hole at the bottom. That was when I realized that the crack was closed! I tried to rub around where the crack was and I pushed that part, but nothing budged! I was frantic. I was too scared to scream, so I slid down and wept on the floor. I wish I had not come. I wish that I had not come. I wish. . . . . . .   I drifted off to sleep. Suddenly, something shook me to awaken. It was a butterfly!  "I am the queen of all the butterflies. I can easily go through solids. " I stared at the butterfly in wonder. There was something about her that made her look as if she was the fairies friends.  "Do you know the Shee fairies? The leader of that is Gwendolyne, "  "Ah! They are my friends! You are the new fairy aren't you! "  "Yes! I am! " I cheerfully replied. All at once, I was in Ireland.  "Thank you! " But the strange thing was that I was supposed to be in India. Gwendolyne came up to me.  "The adventure would not open up in India. Wow! The witches are already here! Here is the spell book! " I caught the book and flipped it to the never-come-back spell.  "YUTU! RUHE! DRE! DAS! WEG! THING! RING! FOR! LASTOW! " The witches disappeared. But I knew that all my adventures were not over.   I would come across the master of the witches, then other enemies. I was glad that I was realeased from being scared. I climbed into the dolphin and I climbed through the whole that the butterfly made. I went home and wrote in my diary. I was scared, but these adventures are the oppurtunities to show how I can be brave and strong with the small resources we have.
