title: I Am a Creative and Music-Loving Girl

I am a creative and music-loving girl

I feel excited about possibilities everywhere.

I dream that I've built a solution to a persistent problem,

and I pretend that these imagined creations could materialize before me,

and I hope that I can make a good impact on the world.

I am a creative and music-loving girl.

 

When I go outside, I see the families of birds twittering excitedly in their nests,

And the smell of my mother's delicious food tints the air.

The sound of my sister playing the piano is clear,

like a knife through water

And for an instant, I touch the sense of peace.

I am a creative and music-loving girl.

 

I understand that evil will never end,

And I worry about strife that spreads

But still, I wonder why people do the bad things they do,

for it upsets me that cruel judgement can be made.

But I say that you can always do something if you have a passion for it,

So I always try to solve problems that are in front of me.
