Me,at school,
  
hungry
  
not for food,
  
but for something
  
that cannot be expressed
  
Me at lunch,
  
hungry
  
not for food
  
but for some people
  
that cannot be shared
  
Me at class again
  
hungry
  
not for food,
  
but for a feeling
  
that cannot be shown
  
Me at the next class
  
hungry
  
not for food
  
but for something
  
that cannot be replaced
  
Me at home
  
No hunger
  
not because of food,
  
but for my family,
  
and all of the love they give me.
