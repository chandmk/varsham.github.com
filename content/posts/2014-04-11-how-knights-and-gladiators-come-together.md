title: How Knights And Gladiators Come Together
url: /?p=4831
---

I was a knight. A training knight, to be specific.This is the Rennaissance time. All the Gladiators would pick on us. Especially Alex. I always secretly hope that we can defeat them soon. But that will never happen. I had sweat all over my face at the end of class because I was thinking so hard about this. On the way home, I accidently bumped into a gladiator. My big mistake. I sucked my lips as I slowly tried to pass him without any insults. Luckily the gladiator turned away from me, as if I was an unbearable thing. I ran as fast as I could until I was home. I looked out the window and saw the messenger. Why is the messenger here? I haven't experienced any messages in the afternoon. The messenger left the message at my front door. I went outside after the messenger left to see the note. This is what I saw:

Dear Richardson,
  
There is a dragon at Valley Hill.
  
Everyone is afraid of it. It comes out at sunrise,
  
and comes back at afternoon. This October, it has to be done before Old Hallows' Eve. You have a month.

Good Luck,
  
From the school Knights and Armor

A chill ran through me. I knew that I couldn't do this on my own. I ran to Douglass's house and read him the note. The only words I heard Douglass utter were, "We'll meet at sunrise. "

At sunrise, Douglass and I went to the hill. I hoped that my teacher had informed mine and Douglass's mother that we are on a mission. We finally reached the hill  and climbed it.  We hid behind a bush so that the dragon wouldn't see us. But I was shaking so much that I jerked. Douglass fell over. Dangerous mistake. I froze with horror. The dragon was staring at me with it's black beady eyes. We stared at the dragon, unable to move.   We were defeated. We both scrambled down the hill. But then, I heard the terrible thing that Douglass said.

 "Let's go get the gladiators. "

 "Douglass! " I said sharply. But I knew that Douglass was right.

We asked the gladiator teacher for Alex and Beanie. When we got them, we pulled the 2 gladiators into the hallway and  told them of our plans. We also flattered them so they would accept the job. They did, and  we happily went to our class and went on with the day  while the gladiators fought the dragon.  When it was time to go home, the gladiators tiredly walked up to us. We knew what that meant.

The next morning, Douglass met up with me. He said,  "Let's fight  with the gladiators. "

I was surprised but I decided to follow his plan. We told the teachers that we had to go. We picked up the gladiators again, and we went off to the hill.

We cornered the dragon. Finally, it perished with the clatter of our spears. We were greatly congratulated. The gladiators realized that when everyone worked together, everything worked.
