There's that cherry blossom tree

waving to me,

There's that big old oak tree

groaning with age.

There's that young tree,

refusing to be put down

By the strife Mother Nature

places before it.

But there's that pine tree,

it's pine needles as green as

the grass on the ground in summer,

And there it stands,

tall and proud,

even when the first snow

threatens its downfall.
