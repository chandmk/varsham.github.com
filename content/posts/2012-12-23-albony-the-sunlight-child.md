Her matirials were, plastic, leather, and an old shirt. First Albony decided to make a house. First, she used plastic to make the roof of the house, next she used the left over plastic and made the walls, then she decided to make furniture inside so the house won’t be boring. Then she used alot of plastic to make the bed and for the sheet and blanket of the bed she used the old shirt. Since she had nothing to do with the house she made a 3 dimentional doll and put it in the house and for other furniture for the house she used plastic. She made 2 other houses with the same material for her other two sisters. On Easter she gave the gifts with a card saying:

###### This is a gift for you sister. If you want to open it, you can. I hope you will like my gift. {#this_is_a_gift_for_you_sister_if_you_want_to_open_it_you_can_i_hope_you_will_like_my_gift}
