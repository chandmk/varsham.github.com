Oh! Licorice and candy canes
  
and Trick or Treat was a fame
  
It ought to be a shame
  
that it comes every year
  
there's nothing to fear
  
on Old'Hallows'Eve
  
Ghosts, Princess's
  
so many dresses
  
to Wear
  
You don't have to glare
  
on Halloween
  
&#8216;Cause you stuff your mouth with sweets
  
You never have to eat meats
  
&#8216;Cause all you need
  
and all you feed
  
on are sweets!
  
But here the dark side comes,
  
The dentists
  
horrid things,
  
They stuff your mouth with shame
  
You can't eat sweets when they came,
  
&#8216;Cause they kill the glee
  
Oh! I wish I could flee,
  
But now I know to limit my candy.
