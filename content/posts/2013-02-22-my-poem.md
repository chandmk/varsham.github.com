I always want to improve,

When I always not sooth

When I waste a lot of food

in my grumpy mood

I always like to play

and that's what I say

everyday.

My mom gives me math

My mom gives reading

and I never do seeding

I improve every time

I should give lime

and I help my mom

everytime when I can
