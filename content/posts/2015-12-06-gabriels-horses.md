Gabriel's Horses is the first book of the Racing To Freedom trilogy. Summary: Gabriel and his father are slaves. He overtakes a race, but then finds out that his father has enlisted in the Union army and won't be with Gabriel and his mother. Afterwards, Master Giles sends for a new trainer and jockey: Flanagan and Newcastle.

They have cruel ways with Master Giles horses, and they ride them harsh when Master is not around. When Newcastle beats Aristo, Gabriel's horse, he realizes that he has had enough. But what can he do now?

This book has the sadness of Sounder, the happiness of Sleeping Beauty at the end, and the adventure of Robinson Crusoe. I loved that odd mix of tales with a little twist at the end. This heartwarming book would be good for everyone 9 and older.
