I really liked  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Eggs</span>, a book about a boy who lost his mother, but changes when he gains a new friend.

At first, David seemed so disagreeable, but later, because of Spinelli's ability to keep a question of  "Why? " pulsing through our mind, I found out that David was only disagreeable because he had lost his mother in a way that felt like a punch in the gut. The pain lasted for days. But then, when he meets Primrose, he changes. Primrose is a carefree girl with a  "crackpot " mother, who is somewhat disagreeable, and she loves pretending. For instance, she pretended to be a dead body, and in another scene, she pretended to be David's mother. They are VERY unlikely pair, because Primrose is almost as disagreeable as David, and so I was surprised that they got along(sometimes). Jerry Spinelli concocted this great story that is really unique, or, in other words, unlike any other.
