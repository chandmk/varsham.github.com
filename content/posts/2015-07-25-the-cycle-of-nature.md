The snow falls

like angels from heaven

Soft and dainty

Falling on the grass

Which was once green

Until spring comes

The snow melts away

showing the grass once again

With that full green color

Finally it's summer

The vapor greets us

Beads of sweat drip down our backs

Slapping away mosquitos

In summer, the stores with the repellent

Are in low supply

School's out

Finally it's fall

School starts again

It's a cycle of nature

Nature's secret ways
