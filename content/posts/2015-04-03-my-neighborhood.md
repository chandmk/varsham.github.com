I live in the suburbs. Whenever I go outside, I hear the deep barking of dogs. In the evenings, it smells like after a bonfire. On my section of the street, there are the perfect hiding places, so Hide and Go Seek is a popular game in my circle of friends. There are lots of trees fit for climbing, and in one of my friend's backyard, there were 2 swings. They took 1 of the swings down, because the trees was rotting where it hung.
  
In spring, I hear the bird's delicate songs, and see the robins flying all about. I hear the foot steps of people running on residential sidewalks. My street is a quiet street. I can never get bored.
  
In the summer, the sun always beats down on our sweaty necks. We like wearing flip-flops in the summer. We have to bring out the fans to turn on at night because in summer, the rooms are hot. I also rains a lot.
  
In fall, the trees shed their colorful leaves. We go to farmer's markets to buy lots of apples. On school days, I like treading through heavy clumps of leaves and jumping into gigantic leaf piles.
  
In winter I wear tons of layers and schools are usually canceled. I like building snowmen.n My sister and I once built an igloo! I clutch my arms around my coat to trap in the heat. And when spring comes, I am relieved.
