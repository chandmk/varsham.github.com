Anne Macolly was a magician. She had a wand. One day, she was thinking about what she wanted. She figured out. "I want something, just something magical. " Anne thought to herself, what magic words would make her magical thing.  "AHBEEPREEGAW! " Yelled Anne. That was her magic words. Then suddenly a sparkling blue car appeared before her. Her gasp was heard by a man dressed in black.
  
 "What a nice place to rest. The seats are very comfy and cozy. Good car. "
  
The man said to Anne,  "I am the magician, you got all your magic from. Put the wand at your house. "
  
 "No. " replied Anna in a very upset tone.
  
 "Getting that wand everyday, eh? Now you have to stop that. Magic is only used for saving people, not for people who are selfish. "
  
 "I am not selfish, and go away. " Yelled Anne.
  
So, the man in the black dress vanished. Anne saw that her hand were empty.
  
Then she realized that she should not care about herself only, she should care about other people as well.
