One day, little Cassie walked across the pasture. The grass sparkled with the light of the Sun. The trees were entirely covered with blossoms. To Cassie, it felt like a dream. Cassie walked everyday, until she wanted color to the grass. Cassie would trade anything for colored grass. Suddenly an idea sprang up in her mind. She got her paint brushes and paints. Cassie painted the grasses like stripes of colors. Then Cassie became deflated, when she realized that her father would mow the lawn. Her dad would not want to see a lawn like that. Then the colors of the grass reflected to a rainbow! And the grass turned green back again.
