The seed grows,

The green sprouts emerge from the earth

Like reluctant school children

On a first day of school

But when the thunder strikes

The lightning illuminates the silent night

Terrible rains pour down

Like children swarming out at their recess time

But the sprouts stay

Leaves slowly grow

Their color bright green

With the radiance of a freshly painted piece of art.

The sprouts grow

into a small tree

Like the broccoli that mothers pack for their children

But then the large winds blow

The young tree falters

But it still stands

Like one who stands up strongly for himself

The roots grow

Snaking down through the soil

day by day

week by week

Years pass

The tree gives shade

To weary travelers passing by

Like man in society

Out to help others

But then a seed falls,

And small winds carry it away

To start a new life.
