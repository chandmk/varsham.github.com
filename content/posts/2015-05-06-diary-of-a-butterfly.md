Hello! I am a larva. I remember (not too long ago) that I came out out of that tight, cramped egg. Ughhh!!! Now I have to eat alot and grow big. I don't know how big I'll get, but I will eat as much as I can.   Anyways, milkweed is there to eat up, right?

Now I am getting ready to pupate.That means that I am getting ready to make a shell around my body, or make a chrysalis. I will have to stay in it for a very long time!

I am now sitting on a branch. I am finally a butterfly! My wings are damp. I'll just have to wait a bit before my wings are dry. Then, I can fly!

Wheeee! It's fun gliding around the sky. My wings aren't wet anymore. Ahhhh!!!!! A predator! Good thing I blend into this yellow flower.
