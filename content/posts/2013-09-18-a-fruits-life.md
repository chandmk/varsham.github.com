I am a fruit.The farmer helped me grow.And I am an Apple. My friend Banana was also grown by by the same farmer. What a nice farmer! This is a story of a fruit's life. One day (Apple was already grown) Banana had his father and mother go to work. Banana could not stay home alone. So our family took care of him. I was happy because Banana was my friend he was having a play date with me. When Banana saw my room, he put two stickers on my wall. Then he laughed out loud!  "What's wrong Banana? " I asked.  "Look at the stickers! ". I started laughing too. Those stickers were FUNNY FRUITS stickers. The stickers looked silly! I heard some talking from downstairs. Then suddenly Blueberry burst in to my room. Blueberry was a mean bully.  "Ha Ha Apple and Banana scaredy cats! " Blueberry laughed. Brave Banana walked up and shouted on Blueberry's face,  "Quit it! ". Now Blueberry pretended to whine. I promised my self I will stand from bullies like Blueberry. I the Apple thanked Banana. I hope he will remain my best friend forever until the farmer picks us ... ...
