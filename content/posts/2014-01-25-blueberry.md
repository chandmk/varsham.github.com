Blueberry that little bird, that sweet bird sings for me
  
Which gives me comforts all day long
  
Just like a mom and daughter together
  
But the bird is just like my sister
  
But once Blueberry ran away
  
But still I hear her calls of,  "tweet toot tweet toot "
  
But I miss her very much and she is inside me
