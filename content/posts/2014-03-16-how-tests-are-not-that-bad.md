I put my head down as my test time went on. It was the hardest test any 4th grader could understand.   I wish I had studied. I just could not remember what this 4th grade math was. Some pain was in my bones, and I could not bear it.  "Test time is over! Put down your folders! Time for lunch! "   said my teacher.  "Lucky classmates! " I thought. Every other 4th grader quickly from their seats and turned in their papers. Everyone but me.    "Cassie? Are you okay?  " It was the soft voice of my teacher.  "No, " I muttered.    "I am sorry for that. But that shouldn't stop you from your test, don't you think?  " I quietly scowled.    "Why do 4th graders get the MSA? I already had it last year! " I wailed.    "You are a responsible 4th grader, and you should be happy with what you have. " The teacher was beginning to get cross. My eyes filled with tears that dropped on my horrible test. I slowly trudged   to the TURN &#8212; IN   box and weakly put the test paper in the box.   Then, the teacher gave me permission to go to the nurse's room. I walked to the nurse's room. She checked my temperature which was 1.08 degrees.  "You have high fever! " She said. The nurse immediatley   called my mom and I was brought home. I dreamed about that nightmare giving test during my extra rest time. But I twisted and turned in the extra sleep. I did not feel good at all. After a small dinner, I went to bed that night with the same, restless sleep. During the night, my mom gave me some medicine. Also, I saw my mom hovering over me when I was awake. The next day, I stayed at home. My mom checked my temperature Which was now 1.00. Well, I got a little better, at least. The next day, I had the symptoms. Then after that, I was 98 degrees. So I went to school late. The test time was over, but I had to finish my test after math. I did it very well and calm. A week later, the test scores came. I was the only one who got 100%! I happily skipped to the bus and told my mom. Yesssss!
