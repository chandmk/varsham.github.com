Two notorious wildfires had raged through the USA. The earliest of these wildfires occurred in June, 1988. That fateful proved to be a very terrible day for everyone at that time. Three years later, in October, 1991, another wildfire erupted in Oakland, California. This day also proved to be terrible.

In Wyoming, Yellowstone park officials were suffering many firs. But none of the fires were major. Even so, firefighters were sent out to battle every blaze. Meanwhile, scientists had figured fire was a main, helpful, part of nature's cycle. THe scientists presented their discovery to the park officials and convinced them to stop battling every blaze that came across them. Thanks to the scientist, the forests in Yellowstone was clear of diseased trees, dead pine needles, and many other unnecessary fire fuel. But the Great Fire started. During the fire, more than 9,500 firefighters from all over the country helped battle the blaze. THe fire had started in the natural parts of Yellowstone. Old Faithful Inn, an ancient village, caught fire. The firefighters leaped to the rescue and managed to save the inn. Just as the fire was at it's worst, Old Faithful erupted. At just the right moment. The famous geyser spouted out the water, covering and extinguishing the fire. The Great Fire was over.

Fire caught the dry grass on the hills. Not far off was a city.That city was Oakland, California. Unlike Yellowstone, Oakland's fire started near a populated city. Yellowstone's fire started in the forest. That week in Oakland, strong winds blew. Embers flew with the wind, landing nearer and nearer to houses. On the other hand, Yellowstone's Great Fire had a lot of natural fuel, which allowed to fire to spread further and further. 3,000 houses were burned. Sadly, 25 people were killed. After the fire, the cost of repairing the damage caused by the fire was more than $1,000,000,000! But in Yellowstone, nature took its course and helped itself.

Both fires were very different, but both of then caused severe damage. They both had similar impacts on the environment.
