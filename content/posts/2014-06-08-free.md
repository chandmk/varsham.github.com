I run outside,
  
The breeze rushes past me
  
I breathe,
  
I feel fresh air
  
I run till I can't,
  
Panting hard
  
Laughing,
  
Making bracelets of flowers
  
Honeysuckles,
  
Eat them up
  
Sweet honey,
  
Climbing trees
  
Fighting for the swing,
  
Running
  
Picking up sticks,
  
Taking leaves off trees
  
Brilliant blue sky,
  
Oh no! A car comes!
  
Back out of the way,
  
Sweating hard
  
Hot sun,
  
Sit in the shade
  
Cool and dark,
  
Playing with sand
  
Building sandcastles in the sand box,
  
Tired out
  
1 friend has to go,
  
So does the other
  
Swinging alone,
  
Mom calls me
  
Coming inside,
  
Tired and dull
  
Eating an ice cream sandwich.
  
Time for work
  
Hard on piano,
  
Feeling happy.
