There are many

who cross the line

and once they do

they never come back

Tis' the line of good and bad

When one becomes bad

They never become good

When you cross that line

that doesn't exist

You have no meaning

Your heart becomes rocky

Never feeling any touch of love

Unless you change

Until your soul forgives you.
