One day, there were 2 little girls with their dearest mother. The younger one was named Varsha,and the older one was named Srija. For Varsha and Srija, it was mother's day. The day before, they planned to make breakfast, but they woke up too late. So the younger girl decided to do a secret gift that her mother had to guess at the end of the day. She was also planning a wonderful party, and she hoped it would come out well. And it did!
