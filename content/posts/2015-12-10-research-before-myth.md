The demon was surprised at how small his ask was. The demon let the brahmin have his 3 paces of land. So, the brahmin grew and grew until his feet were so big. In one step, he covered 1 world, the second step he covered another world, and the third step was right on top of the demon’s head. Then, just as the brahmin was about to crush the demon, he realized just then that the demon had no ego anymore. The brahmin let him go.**

 

  * **Parashuramavatara: Parashurama conquered the kingdom that stole a valuable cow and calf. Then that kingdom killed his father for revenge. At last, Parashurama killed the murderers.**

But when replied that he was already married, the demon girl flew at Rama’s wife, Sita. Lakshmana cut of her nose and ears, and she returned back to her brother’s place. For revenge, Ravana abducted Sita, forcing her to marry him. Eventually, by building a bridge over the long span of water that was between the forest and the place where Sita was kept after her abduction. Rama and Ravana flew into harsh battle and the demon kingdom lost. Sita was united with her husband again.

  * Krishnavatara: An evil demon named Kamsa was informed that he would be killed by one of Devaki’s sons. Devaki was the sister of this evil demon.

  * Meanwhile, a couple of tricksters got a mace and hid it under a girl’s dress. Then they asked a guru(a knowledgable person) what would the baby be: a girl or a boy? The guru detected that the “baby” was actually a mace, and told the boys furiously to mash up the mace into pieces. There was a piece that couldn’t be pounded, so they threw it in as it was. The piece was swallowed by a fish, and the fish was caught by a fisherman. Finding the piece of iron in the fish, he fitted the iron head onto an empty arrow. This arrow was used to kill the virtuous Vishnu, for the fisherman mistaked his foot for a fish.

  * Buddavatara: When the baby Sidartha was born, a guru told the father of the baby that Sidartha was either going to become a guru or an emperor. Sidarta’s father was determined to make his son an emperor. So, Sidarta grew up in the comforts of the kingdom. When Sidartha married, he knew of no pain, until he went for a ride outside of the city and realized of all of the pain and misery a person could have. Finally, he decided that he wasn’t happy with the comforts of a kingdom, so he became a sage. Sidartha then became Buddha.
