My family and I were coming back from Back to School Night.I happily skipped ahead of them. I ran to the door and waited for them. Finally, my smiling parents came to the door and unlocked it. I ran to the room where the sofas were and ran back into the front door room to pull them in. But they weren't there.
  
I ran upstairs and checked - They weren't there. As I helplessly looked all over the room, I didn't notice 2 vampires, coming silently behind until I whirled around. Now the vampire's strides were getting faster. I pressed myself hard against the wall.
  
Suddenly, rainbows formed around me. I couldn't clarify of what I was really seeing. My vision finally cleared. But then, I was spinning like a tornado.
  
I could hear the whispery voices of the 2 monsters.
  
 "We've wanted you all these years and we got you! "

 "**NOOOOOO! "**

But a beautiful light behind me comforted me as I turned around. It was a beautiful fairy princess.

 "Send them out of this world! " she said. Then she turned to me.  "Your parents were captured by the vampires. " She stepped aside.

My mother and my father were there! I ran to them. Thank you, fairy princess!
