It all began with A(_drum roll_):_
  
_ A is some cool gymnastics equipment
  
and B you can climb on,
  
C turned a certain angle you can slide on,
  
D is a house
  
of all your dreams
  
and E and B are brothers
  
F always
  
Tries to be like E
  
But she is almost there
  
G is a gymnast
  
so flexible
  
H a comfy bed
  
That children go to at
  
bedtime,
  
I can fit through
  
tiny gaps
  
And J is just like C,
  
K is different from all the others
  
always branches out,
  
L can measure
  
any child of any size,
  
M is a mountain
  
that hikers climb
  
and N is just one
  
O is a balloon
  
that's lost it's string
  
and P is the same but with the string
  
Q is a cat
  
with its tail stuck out,
  
R is a ballet dancer
  
S is a snake
  
hissing all the while
  
T is a tree
  
with only two branches
  
U is a room
  
without a roof
  
V is the same but not curved
  
W is some upside-down
  
mountain
  
and X is like
  
branching out,
  
while Y is like the tree
  
and lastly,
  
finally,
  
Z says  "The end! "
