<span style="text-decoration: underline">CLARENCE</span>
  
Clarence hovered over her studies, her experiments. She was a robotics scientist.
  
Suddenly she had an idea.
  
It would be the greatest one yet.
  
Her project.
  
In a matter of minutes, Clarence had created her life long dream.
  
The robot moved and waved his hand.  "Hi. "

<span style="text-decoration: underline">BRONCHUS(BROHN-KUS)  </span>_Centuries later ... ...._
  
He was a robot. He was named Bronchus.
  
Bronchus turned to a Canadian robot and asked him to ring the bell. The bell told the robots when there was an announcement.
  
 "Fellow robots! "
  
Bronchus's voice projected into the small, robot-sized, microphone.
  
 "I would like to commit a plot of revenge. "
  
In his mind, he knew what the revenge was.
  
The robots gasped.
  
One Mexican robot whispered to another Mexican robot, "Revenge? How does King Bronchus know what the revenge would be, after what they have done to us? They have done something beyond measure, That even the samurai robots cannot master! "
  
This started the murmuring. It grew louder and louder until -

 "SILENCE!! "

The robots were so startled. They looked down guiltily at the floor, as if all of a sudden, they were prisoners proven guilty.
  
Bronchus leaned back in the chair that Thwaites, the same Canadian robot from the beginning had put for him. Thwaites was Bronchus's only living relative.
  
This project must be the world greatest yet.

It would be The Project.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">CLARENCE</span>
  
That factory.
  
It opened up a long time ago, perhaps more than a century ago.
  
A robot-destroying factory.
  
It was called  _<span style="color: #ff0000">Away with Mechanics.</span>_
  
Written in the same red color.
  
What if Bronchus got it?
  
He would be smashed to bits.
  
That factory was so pathetic.
  
Poor Bronchus.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">BRONCHUS</span>

Thwaites looked worriedly at his father Bronchus, who was sitting down in his small comfortable chair, deep in thought.

 "What is wrong with majesty sir? "

 "Get Barbel, Thwaites. "

 "But- "

 "I SAID GET BARBEL, THWAITES! "

 "If your Majesty says so. "

Thwaites said with fright.
  
He quickly walked away, leaving the room to silence.

_<span style="color: #ff0000">Away With Mechanics </span>_had already wiped out many of the French robots, including his dearest friend, Narvil.
  
He spoke of Napolean all the time but King Bronchus (As everyone called him for he was the robot leader) loved to listen to all this.

But the day Narvil left ... ... ... ... ....

His eyes filled with tears thinking of this.
  
Bronchus quickly wiped the tears away when he saw Thwaites arriving with Barbel.
  
Barbel was a   robot from Thailand that Bronchus appointed as a samurai robot.

 "King, Thailand is in big trouble, please let me go to them! "
  
Barbel struggled under Thwaites's hard grip.

 "Chill Barbel. We are going to go there to commit my revenge. "

 "What did Thailand do sir? "

 "They set up that robot destroying factory an put it in Slovakia!! "

 "Why don't we go to Slovakia then, instead? "

 "Thailand first, and that's that. "

 "Oh, THwaites, let me go! "
  
Thwaites had tightened his grip on Barbel.

 "Why have you called me, sir? " said Barbel, still struggling.

 "You are coming with us. " THwaites said confidently.
  
He dragged him over to the King who put a sleeping potion on Barbel and carried him to the country portal.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">CLARENCE</span>

Clarence wondered what happened.

She couldn't stop that factory.

Why were they doing this?

Clarence had to find out.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">BRONCHUS</span>

Barbel woke up as soon as they arrived.

 "Are we in Thailand? "

 "Ugh, I should have put a long-term sleeping potion on you. "
  
Instead, The king sprayed Barbel with mute potion.

Barbel quieted.
  
For the first time, Bronchus saw Thailand.

For a second, Bronchus was speechless.
  
Then he came back to his usual imperious/cruel way.
  
Barbel still was so mute.

Then Barbel saw a great friend. Bronchus quickly sprayed him again so he could talk to his friend.

 "Hello! "

And that was all.

Then, King Bronchus raised his hand.

Thwaites was very afraid.

The ocean lunged forward.

Bronchus had created a tsunami.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">CLARENCE</span>

Clarence knew all the facts.

She knew that the factory was in Slovakia.

Clarence typed the factory's name, and then stepped in the portal that she had made.

She was now in Slovakia.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">BRONCHUS</span>

Thwaites felt Barbel trying to lunge forward, but he kept his grip.

 "Let go of him, Thwaites. "

Thwaites slowly let go of the samurai.

Barbel lunged forward.

Bronchus sprayed him again and Barbel was not mute anymore.

 "He wanted to go to Thailand so I sent him to Thailand. "

 "Your Majesty? I have a question. "

 "Yes, son? "

 "Does he turn into a human when he goes to Thailand? "

The king smiled down at Thwaites.

His long-lost son.

 "Thwaites, The robots all turn into human when they go into any country with people in it. My son, I will tell you how you were born. You are 13 years old and you are old enough. "

  1. Thwaites's Birth

Latvia, Bronchus's wife had given birth to a beautiful baby robot. Suddenly, the next day, he saw a note. He found out that his wife and baby robot was kidnapped.

Bronchus had searched all over the place.

He then gave himself a good long cry.

Then, he saw a young woman and a baby robot on his ddor step.

Latvia was on his doorstep.

She was dead.

But the baby wasn't.

Bronchus named the Baby robot Thwaites, meaning Wonder in roboat language.

♣  ♣  ♣  ♣  ♣  ♣  ♣  ♣  ♣

 "That is the story of your birth, Thwaites. "

 "Thank you for telling me, father. "

Suddenly, Bronchus's messenger bee flew over.

 "What is it, Dewdrop? " said Bronchus, lovingly stroking the bees wings.

Dewdrop dropped the message his lap and flew off.

The message told him that   there was trouble in Greenland.

 "Let's go! " cried Thwaites.

They stepped in to the country portal and were gone.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">CLARENCE</span>

Clarence arrived at Slovakia. She looked around for the robot-destroying factory.

Clarence glanced at her GPS and saw she was going in the wrong direction.

Then she looked at the amount of charging.

She saw that there was 7% left.

Clarence was lost.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">BRONCHUS</span>

They arrived right next to the tall, ice capped, mountains.

Thwaites shivered.

 "I know it is cold, Thwaites. "

Thwaites smiled gratefully at his father.

 "I wonder what the trouble is, son. "

 "Check back at Dewdrop's note father. It might tell us. "

Bronchus opened the folded note.

 "It is not there, but thanks for the suggestion. "

 "We must explore out then, " said Thwaites.

They went to the southern side of Greenland.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">CLARENCE</span>

Clarence was afraid.

What should she do?

She didn't know.

Her GPS was dead in power.

She looked around warily.

She looked this way and that.

The factory was probably far, far, away.

Clarence stepped into the country portal.

She transported herself to her laboratory.

There had to be some other way.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">BRONCHUS</span>

The southern side of Greenland had tall grassy hills.
  
 "I thought that Greenland would be cold everywhere, but I guess I was wrong, Thwaites. " Bronchus said, chuckling.

Thwaites said nothing to this.
  
Bronchus knew that his son was deeply in thought, so he did not say a word.
  
The silence sustained as father and son looked for the trouble.
  
Suddenly, he saw something.
  
A clump of his own robot kind!
  
They were Welsh robots disobeying their own king!

<span style="text-decoration: underline">CLARENCE</span>

Clarence felt as if she was a disgrace to her own robot.

He was crushed already.

Even though the robot was gone, she still have to save the other robots.

I know, reader that you know she is wrong.

Bronchus, her robot is not dead.

He is going around commiting his revenge.

Until a bunch of Welsh robots knocks his socks off.

In a bad way.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">BRONCHUS</span>

 "How dare you disobey your own king! " bellowed Bronchus.  "I sent you to France and here you are in Greenland, snoozing about! " Then, his voice became more soft and dangerous.

 "You thought that you were the king didn't you? Oh yes, you wanted to be king.

Do you want to be a samurai and face the same pain as Barbel? " There was a malicious twinkle to his eye and a malicious smile tugging at his lips.

The Welsh robots paid no attention to him.

The king sent bursts of wind that made them fly all the way to France.

&#8216;Don't come back until you are done! " yelled Bronchus, with a malicious laugh.

Now, reader you must feel bad for Thwaites. No?

Would you like it if you had to watch gruesome things like that?

Well, it's your choice if you don't want to put yourself in Thwaites shoes.

Thwaites was feeling very uncomfortable at this point, and you don't know how badly Thwaites wanted to tell his dad.

But Thwaites was afraid.

What if his father did the same things that he watched him do to others to Thwaites?

He didn't want that, so he decided to hold his tongue.

 "That was the trouble there in Greenland. Thank goodness to Dewdrop. " The father smiled at his son.

The two headed out for a vacation on the Big Island in Hawai'i.
