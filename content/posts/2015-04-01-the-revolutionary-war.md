British and America
  
declared war,
  
on 1775
  
one day before
  
April's 20th
  
That's when the guns raised
  
Independence
  
was a great struggle
  
when each took their side,
  
Soldiers were enlisted
  
from everyplace
  
Just to protect the country
  
All with different names
  
one great leader
  
that lead America
  
by the great name of George
  
Washington led his group
  
all the way in Valley Forge
  
The soldiers felt like wrangling
  
talked spiteful things behind his back
  
The soldiers fought
  
really hard
  
just for their independence
  
and finally in 1783
  
just one day before September's 2nd
  
That's when the guns lowered
  
America finally declared victory!
