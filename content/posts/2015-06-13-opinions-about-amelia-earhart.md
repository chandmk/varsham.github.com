title: Opinions About Amelia Earhart

Amelia Earhart, a rising female flier, is taking lessons from Neta Snook, a renowned flier. When Neta Snook first laid her eyes on the white-gloved lady, she thought, “More silly people with silly questions.” However, she soon realized that Amelia only wanted Neta to instruct her in the field of flying. Amelia started taking lessons with Neta beginning on the third of January, 1921.

On the first lesson, Amelia arrives wearing khaki pants, boots, a colorful scarf, and a knee length jacket which she has slept in for several nights to give it a used look. She always carries a book. Neta says, “I got accustomed to seeing Amelia with a book. She always carried one.”

Amelia is a beginner, and she makes many dangerous mistakes. When Amelia flew in Neta’s fixed Canuck from World War 1, she turned toward Long Beach, which was approximately sixty miles away! Neta knew something was going to go wrong. She called to Amelia sitting in the front cockpit of the Canuck and said, “Did you check the amount of fuel in the plane?”

Amelia replied, “No, but Mr. Kinner always checks the fuel in the airplane.” Neta was horrified. She knew that “good pilots should always check their plane’s fuel level.” Neta turned the plane around and a very relieved Bert Kinner rushed out. He said, “I didn’t fill it because the fuel tanker never arrived,”

Neta was infuriated. “Not for the first time,” she said, “I wondered if I had misjudged her ability.”

Thea Rasche is a trick flier who performs tricks before crowds of people. However, during the midst of one of her performances, she lost control and accidently crashed her plane into a nearby swamp. She is infuriated by the discouraging comments. So, she rushed into a plane and started performing backflips, loops, and many other amazing tricks. The crowd of people gradually came back, amazed by Amelia’s tricks.

Amelia showed that women are just as good as men are thought to be.
