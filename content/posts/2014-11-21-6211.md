I was a spring girl. I control the weather in spring. Mother was the controller of fall, my father was the controller of spring and winter. That is why father was dull when he was sad, to resemble his winter powers, and he was extremely excited when he was happy, to resemble his spring powers. Mother was like any human mother, because fall is in the middle of hot and cold. Even though she acted like a human mother, she wasn't. She was a Seasoner, a girl who is controlling seasons. Seasonons are the boys who control weather. But that was just the introduction, not the story. You must go on just to hear the real thing.

**MY BIRTH**

 "Just look at her! " exclaimed Mary.  "She is wonderful! " exclaimed Alex, her husband. The baby was a beautiful controller of spring.  "A Seasoner, the first one related to me, except my mother! " She exclaimed. Mary hugged her happy husband. The couple happily raised the child, which grew up to be  me. But that was when I was 8. Both died of seasonia, a disease like pnemonia. I'm 9 now and the couple, my mother and father, who lovingly raised me is now dead.
