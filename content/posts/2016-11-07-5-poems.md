**Troll**

I dare not cross the bridge
  
that lies in front of me
  
for a troll is underneath
  
waiting
  
for me to walk across
  
to the greener grass
  
on the other side.

**Walking Stick**

Through my window
  
you can see
  
my Grandfather's
  
walking stick
  
lying peacefully on the countertop
  
waiting for the time
  
that it will be
  
needed again.

 

**Nightmare - Yougn Authors Contest Poem**

You never know
  
what's lurking out there
  
when you are peacefully asleep.
  
At midnight
  
monsters roam free
  
and nightmares are
  
released from the cages of
  
daylight, and they're
  
looking
  
watching
  
waiting
  
for the perfect moment
  
to reveal themselves
  
in a child's mind
  
and when the day breaks,
  
they vanish.
