title: Saferacer-The Importance of Cooperation and Working Together
url: /?p=8241
---

At school, I joined a seminar that took place during recess called Saferacer. I learned that Saferacer was all about building a car individually or with a team and competing against other cars from other schools. Another main constraint was that I had to use recyclable materials. I decided that I wanted to join this seminar because I like to build things, and building a car was beyond my imagination. So I immediately joined the seminar Saferacer.

 

Next we had to decide if we wanted to work individually, or to work with a team to build the car. I decided I wanted to be with a team because I believe in the saying, "Two heads are better than one. " Next, the people who wanted to be in teams had to pick their teams. I landed in a team of 4 people including me, and then another team member joined afterwards during the period that was set for us to build the car.

Working in a team took a lot of cooperation. We had to each listen to each other's ideas, and then we would have to agree on 1 idea if we disagreed, but finally, we worked our disputes out. We did quite well in the competition. We even won second place out of all of the other school's students that participated! In fact, it turned out to be good that I had wanted to be on a team instead of being an individual!
