HI! I'm Blue! I'm part of the MarkerBox community, where all ten of us are residents,  "us " meaning me, Purple, Green, Yellow, Red, Orange, Pink, Black, Brown, and Gray. Purple and Green are my friends, but before, I thought that Black, Brown, and Gray seemed a little shady, but I learned that this was not the case - Black saved me once. But, Yellow, Red, Orange, and Pink are way too peppy for me, so Purple, Green, and I are happy to stay in our little corner of the MarkerBox community, the odd ones out.

Anyway, I'm telling you a story of a horrifying experience, of which Black was the leader, involving a cap. And let it be known that markers can only survive a day without their caps before getting thrown into the Garbage can, which, I heard, leads to a Land Fill, where Garbage gets buried someplace to stay - not my kind of lifestyle!

 "Hey, Blue, bad news, " Green said.  "Caleb's using you and Yellow for a picture of an ocean's waves. "

Just then, Yellow rolled over. She was so excited that she bounced as she rolled:  "This is going to be so much fun!!! "

Green rolled away before she could rant on anymore, but I just tuned her out. Yellow is pretty nice, even if she's really talkative.

Yellow, Orange, and Red were always like that, always looking on the bright side. It  gets annoying after a while if you're like Green, unable to tune them out. Just then, I got picked up, and my cap clicked off, and I felt my breath-holding instincts kick in. I got used a lot, so I was used to this, but Yellow-she was having a hard time, with her eyes all bugged out and gasping for air. I leaned over and told  her, You won't gasp for air like that if you relax. "

When she did, she gratefully sucked in deep breaths, and she whispered,  "Thanks, ". Just then, Caleb's mother called,  "Caleb, come here! " Caleb dropped me, improperly put on Yellow's cap, but he didn't put on mine. Yellow flipped over and clipped hers on, but then she shrieked, because she saw that my cap was off. Everyone came rushing towards her and me, and they made a bigger deal out of it than they should have. Ideally, I could have just rolled over and clipped mine on, but since Yellow called, all her friends began panicking. Orange was talking a mile a minute, and Red was anxiously listening. It was pathetic, but there was nothing I could do, because we were using valuable time when it wasn't such a big deal. Then, Orange's foot tapped the cap. It rolled to the edge of the desk, and even when Black ran towards it, it fell off the desk, too fast for any of us, and Black, teetering on the edge, toppled off, and landed with a barely audible  "clunk ". Green ran to the edge, and peered down cautiously, well away from the edge, when he said,  "He's okay, " Everyone heaved a sigh of relief.  "But, we have to go down there to get him and Blue's cap. " Instinctively, everyone tightened up, and Green jumped off the edge with no trace of fear on his unfathomable face. Purple covered her eyes, but she smiled when Green called out,  "Come down! "

One by one everyone jumped down. Brown ended up pushing Orange off the desk, because she was afraid, and Purple, who jumped off last, pushed me off as well as she could while jumping. When I hit the floor, I lost a lot of ink, which wasn't too fun, paired up with the feeling of slow suffocation. Everyone looked around at the suddenly unfamiliar surroundings, because we had never been off the desk. Carefully, as if there were traps around, Gray stepped forward slowly, followed by everyone else. We looked around, and we realized that we would have to venture into Under the Bed, which, as we heard, had all sorts of traps and heights and many other things that would scare a marker, and if you're imagining something gory, than you've understood exactly what we heard - and you can also understand why we weren't too keen on going to Under the Bed. But, it was inevitable, because my cap was down there, so we went.

Instantly, we were plunged into a cavernous gloom, where there was a chilly silence, too frightening for words, even for the Peppy Trio. Suddenly, a high-pitched, immature, voice broke the silence like a weight on thin ice.  "Are you Broom? "

Stuttering, Brown replied,  "No, " He took a deep breath and continued,  "We are part of the MarkerBox community. "

A small dust bunny peered out from an old homework of Caleb's, and when she saw us, she straightened up and said,  "Oh, hi! I'm Curious! "

Yellow waved and said,  "Hi! "

Before Yellow could carry on with a long conversation, Curious said,  "Do you want to see our newest treasure? "

Black was about to refuse, but Purple interrupted, and politely, said,  "Sure, why not?! "

Curious looked delighted to be taken seriously, and she left for a few moments and came back carrying an evidently heavy thing that was large and cylindrical. Specifically a large and cylindrical BLUE thing.

 "Hey! " cried out Red, before anyone could stop her,  "That's Blue's cap! "

Green glared at Red, but Red didn't notice.

 "No, " said Curious innocently,  "It's our new treasure. "

 "Uh ...Can we speak to your leader? " said Green.

 "Sure! Follow me! "

Curious led us through long winding passageways which looked the same as all the others and were brightly lit with Christmas lights that the bunnies had found and put up, with Purple carefully rolling me. I was weakening, already to weak to talk without my cap. At last, Curious cried,  "Here we are! "

At first, it looked like all the other niches put in the tunnel walls in the alleyways, but after our eyes adjusted to the sudden darkness, we realized that this niche was much bigger than the niches we had seen here earlier, and in this niche we saw a regular dust bunny, with a surprisingly loud voice:  "Curious, why did you lead strangers to my Niche? "

 "Father, they -  "

But father interrupted daughter, and the great leader said,  "What do you want, MarkerClan? "

Black pasted a fake brave face on, and stepped forward, regally.  "Blue, this uncapped Marker here, has lost her cap. It is the newest treasure, according to Curious -  " he said, gesturing at the bunny princess -  "and Blue must have or she will die, so we came here to get it back. "

The king replied, after some thought, with an expression which I read to be amused,  "Okay, but on one condition: You give us a gift. "

Evidently, Purple thought this was unfair, but Green silenced her with a gentle shake of his head at her. Just then, Gray whispered something into Black's ear. Black scowled, but he proceeded to repeat what Gray had said to him:  "Well, Dust Bunny King -  "

 "The name is Busy. "

 "Yes, uh, Busy, whenever you need anything written or drawn, you can call on me. "

Busy accepted the offer without much thought, and signaled for his daughter to hand over the cap, and Curious did, but a little sadly. Yellow offered her a winning smile, which gave Curious a little spirit. And finally, just finally, I got my cap back on, and I could talk and laugh and breathe again. It felt great, but not for long.

We went out from Under the Bed, coming back with good stories about the place, when we saw Caleb looming over us, with a puzzled expression on his face, and this might not seem too bad for us markers, but it was very bad, because long ago, Caleb used to have a set of markers that ran out of ink, and fell under the bed. If Caleb mistook us for that set of markers, we would be in the Garbage Can, wasting away in the Land Fill soon to come. He picked us up, about to test us for ink, but when he had his hand subconsciously over the trash on its way to his desk, his cat ran in, and startled, Caleb dropped us. Into the Garbage Can.

A week passed, with all of us silent, and not even Pink, Yellow, Red, and Orange didn't have anything positive to say about this situation. We were stuck, and that was that. We were overcome by a feeling of hopelessness, a hopelessness that choked out all of our happiness and any happy memories we tried to think of. But, when we felt the Garbage Can shake, we knew something was going to happen.

Caleb's mother had the Garbage Can by its rim and she carried it quickly down the stairs and dropped us into a large blue bin. A large lid shut over us, and the world around us was enveloped in darkness. We couldn't see anything, and we longed for those days when we used to sit peacefully on Caleb's desk, complaining about one silly thing or another. We waited there for another day, with a lot of things to think about, when the lid finally opened, and daylight streamed in. A man who was peering over into the blue bin we were in saw us, and picked us up. To himself, he muttered,  "These don't look old - I wonder why the Robinsons threw them away. " He tested us on scrap pieces of Paper that was in the bin, and found that we all worked, He picked us up and carried a piece of paper with him, and put us on Caleb's doormat. With us, he wrote a note that said,  "These still work quite well. And Caleb - they're not about to run out any time soon. "

THE END
