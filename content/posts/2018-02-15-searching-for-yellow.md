I touched my gray lamp that shed gray light, as well as my gray curtains, pausing for a moment to look at the gray, gray sun. Everything was gray. But somehow, I knew that there was something else. I dreamt in color, and I wanted others to see my dream, too, instead of scorn it like that were doing now.

 "Elle! " called my mother. She was wearing a gray apron, and had her gray hair tied up in a bun with a gray hairband. As I looked at it, I wistfully realized that I don't know what the real color of my hair is. Every month, children get their hair dyed gray, to keep the gray consistency throughout Grayworld, but I still ache to know what the true color of my hair is.

 "Just a second, Mother! " I tell her, and sprint to my room.

I lock the gray door and take out a sharp knife, a present from my deceased father. Holding the knife to my hair, I scraped away at the crusty dye and look at the color. It was one that I could not comprehend, and suddenly, I remembered the name -  _yellow_. I had yellow hair, or blonde, whatever you call it. I stopped at my bed and gasped: I had broken a rule. If one of the gray drones outside had seen, I would get in big trouble. I would get a GO, or a Gray Offense. With a GO, you were not allowed privacy, and your room was cleared entirely, with drones watching my progress just outside my window. Swiping the curtains shut, I scooped up the gray dust from the chipped dye of my hair and added a little water to it, making it into paint again. I pressed that to my old desk, trying not to look suspicious. I quickly unlocked my room door and sprinted downstairs, where I saw my mother glaring at me.

 "Elle! You let your dinner go cold! "

 "May I register a regret? "

 "Yes, you may. Eat your slop, Elle, "

 

I quickly ate the gray slop that my mother had made me without a complaint and sprinted upstairs to revel in my newfound discovery. I had  _yellow _ hair. But what color were my eyes? Children were also forced to put gray contact lenses in their eyes when they were younger, and I had figured out how to take mine out a long time ago, but I did not dare to take them out.

Now, I did not care much, because my mother trusted me, and I had privacy, and so I locked the door again and squeezed my left eyes shut. I touched the lense in my right eye and since it was put in my eyes with a laser glue machine, I had to unscrew it out of my eye, which was not at all pleasant. The lenses are not meant to come out, anyway. After I pried out the lenses in both eyes, I had to blink to get used to not having the lenses in my eyes, and looked in the mirror. Ha! This was a color that I knew off the top of my head.  _Blue_.

I had read about colors in the forbidden history section of the Grayschool library by hiding it tucked inside a regular gray book. I was fascinated - why had all of this been eradicated?

I never figured out, though. The librarians removed the section a week after I had smuggled one of those books out.

I blinked my blue, blue, eyes, and decided that it was time to put my lenses back in again. I slid them in, getting used to the sudden change, but wishing that I could take them off and leave them off.

The only world that I had ever know was gray. I was searching for yellow. Yellow other than the color of my hair, but yellow of the old sun, before all color except for gray was eradicated. Searching for yellow.

I grabbed a gray sinch bag of my sister's, and stuffed some slop in a gray container in it, and a little bit of food colored gray water inside my gray waterbottle. I grabbed my gray notepad and my gray pencils and I stepped outside. Searching for yellow, I told myself. Searching for yellow.

I walked forward, passed the school, and suddenly, I was in the gray, gray woods. It was surprising to see how small my district was - it was the smallest in all of Graystate, and it was separated from all the other little  MiniGraystates, so wherever I went, I would be led out of this place. This gray, gray world.

You might be wondering - wouldn't I have missed my mother and my sister?

No. I would not. I was not from this world. I was from Yellowstate, and my mother, escaping from anti-Yellow terrorists in Yellowstate, ran into Graystate, and died giving birth to me here. I was shoved into the hands of a woman named Aida, and her daughter named Masilee, who didn't even want me. They did not treat me well at all.

Suddenly, I passed into a white world. There was nothing in front of me, nothing behind me, just white. I sat down to eat, because my stomach was growling, and I drank some water. Feeling energized, I began to walk faster, and suddenly, I saw a glint.

Yellow?

I saw the glint again, and I began to sprint. Yellow. It was yellow.

I ran, being immersed in the yellow, and the yellow, yellow, sun. The gray dye began melting off my hair, and revealed the yellow color that it was. I slid off my contact lenses and looked at the world with my blue eyes. I had once been searching for yellow, and now I had found yellow.

Searching for Yellow.
