Once there lived a very young koala bear, who did not like eucalyptus which was what koala bears eat. By the way, the young koala bears name was Chester. Chester never ate lunch lunch and dinner which was eucalyptus. That strike of food was making him starve. But finally he made friends with Owen Brown, a giraffe. He ate leaves from the maple tree and Chester loved the leaves. So,in the night Chester snuck to Owen's house and ate ate leaves there.
