CHAPTER 1 - SOPHIE

<span style="color: #000000">The interviewees, Sophie, Theresa, Roy, and Kathryn, sat nervously at the wooden table, their trembling hands laced tightly together. Sophie was tapping her foot twice as fast as the seconds on the clock on the wall across from her, and the others watched her in silence. Suddenly, a man appeared out of the glass doorway across from them.</span>

<span style="color: #000000">All four of them sat in the same room, the room with one glass window that was too tall to see from, and reflected all the light in the room. So, from where the interviewees could see, they could only see the glare of the light in the glass window. There was also a glass door that was opposite them. The door almost blended into the entire room, because the room was painted a blinding, sterile white, with a sweet tinge of sky blue to tone the color down. The floor was made of linoleum, and this too, was blindingly white. All the white made Sophie's head ache, but there was nothing she could do about it. She had been invited to be an interviewee, and here she was.</span>

<span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000000">Suddenly, the door burst open, and a little man in a pinstripe suirt appeared.  "</span>Hello! " he cried.  "I am the Interviewer, although I prefer to be called James. "</span>

<span style="color: #000000">The Interviewer was a short, squat man who liked to keep a jolly smile on his face, and it was a shame that he didn't have a white, wispy beard or mustache, because he could have posed for Santa Claus at  Christmas  events if he had.</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Sophie studied the Interviewer - no, James - and he caught notice of her. He gestured at her and swept his arms to the door  and said, with a smile on his face, of course,  "You first, miss. "</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Sophie groaned internally, but she still forced herself to stand, and followed the smiling interviewer, head held confidently high and arms loose at her sides. She left the original room, only to walk into another, where a desk with two chairs on either side was set up.</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "Please, " said James, politely,  "Sit. " He gestured towards a chair, where Sophie sat and controlled her urge to tap her foot. There was no clock on the wall this time, though.</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "How do you deal with peer pressure? " started the Interviewer.  </span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "Umm ... " Sophie thought. She didn't expect to be asked this question - she'd instead expected to be asked all sorts of business questions. She'd even prepared a list of questions she thought she would be asked during the interview, even though she didn't know much about it and what it was for - she'd only received a mail in her inbox, with a brief summary of the purpose of the interview that really didn't give much information, and of course, it provided an address. But now that she was here, Sophie had to focus on the task at hand.</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "Well, " she started, thinking through her answer carefully before she spoke it.  "I only do things that would help me, and not harm me. I would not let someone else try to force me into doing something, because I want to make the best decisions for my own life. I don't need someone else pressuring me to make a decision. "</span>

<span style="color: #000000">The Interviewer sat back in his seat, eyes thoughtfully narrowed.  "Ah, interesting. So ...have you ever dealt with peer pressure? "</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Sophie immediately recalled a time ...:  "Yes. " Unsure of whether or not James wanted to her the story, she stopped there and waited.</span>

<span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000000">She received another smile from James, who continued, asking the expected question:  "How did you deal with it? Tell me the story. "</span></span>

<span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000000">Sophie began.  "Yes, well, when I was ten years old, I was friends with this popular girl, Julia. One day, she got it in her mind that she wanted to fake sickness and sneak out of the school. She tried to get me to come with her in a variety of ways. "</span></span>

<span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000000">She paused, wondering if she was going on for too long.</span></span>

<span style="color: #000000">But James obviously didn't think so, because he wanted her continue:  "How? "</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "At first, she asked nicely, just as a friend would. But then, when I refused and tried to talk her out of it, she misjudged my intentions and got angry. She called me all sorts of dreadful things. I was tempted to get angry at her back, but then I realized that I knew she didn't mean what she said to me, not really. But despite my protests, she went on out anyway, and of course she got caught. She got a one-week suspension, and a longer groundation from her parents. "</span>

<span style="color: #000000">James smiled.  "Good, good. Thank you for your time. "</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Sophie thanked him and left. Her heartbeat was only just beginning to slow down from the interview.</span>

CHAPTER 2 - KATHRYN

<span style="color: #000000">Kathryn walked in, feeling very nervous, but determined not to show it. This was an interview, after all. She was supposed to put herself in the best light, and what with her accomplishments and preparations, she was confident that she would do well.</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "Hello, " she said to James when she saw him.</span>

<span style="color: #000000">James gestured her towards the seat across from him and said,  "Please, sit. "</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Kathryn  gladly sat. Her  knees where aching from standing in the  blindingly white room for so long.</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "How do you deal with peer pressure? "</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Kathryn's heartbeat quickened. She hadn't known that this was going to be on the interview! But still - Kathryn had to keep calm. She  <em>would</em><span style="color: #000000"> succeed.<span style="color: #000000"> There was no doubt about it.</span></span></span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "I find peer pressure ...a rather pressing issue. " She cringed internally. She realized that she had unintentionally placed a pun in her sentence, and she dearly hoped that even if James caught it, he would still take her seriously.</span>

<span style="color: #000000">A  dancing, mischeivous flame  lit impishly in James' eyes, and Kathryn groaned mentally. So James <em>had  </em>caught the pun.</span>

<span style="color: #000000">She  <em>had  </em>to succeed in this interview. She  <em>had</em> to make him take her seriously.</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "I agree. " said James, a slight touch of humor coloring his loud voice.</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "My mother and father ... " began Kathryn, but stopped, because her mouth dried up, and she couldn't go on. Licking her dry, chapped, lips, she took several deep breaths and began again.  " ...My mother and father had always taught me important life lessons, such as being strong and brave even in difficult situations, like, in this case, peer pressure. No one should be able to make anyone do something that might harm them, and especially want they don't want to do. "</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "Yes, " agreed James.  "Have you ever dealt with peer pressure? "</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Kathryn immediately remembered a time, in college ...:  "Yes. "  <span style="color: #000000">Should she include when?  <em> ...Yes,  </em>she decided.  <em>I will include when.</em>  " ...Two years ago. In college. " she finished.  </span></span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "<span style="color: #000000">Tell me about it.</span> " said James.</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "I had a friend, and to respect her privacy, I will not mention her name. She offered me a cigarette. I refused, of course, because I didn't want to get addited. She grew angry and tried to first, persuade me to take it, but then, she resorted to trying to pressure me into taking the cigarette. At last, she realized that her attempts were futile, and I managed to not only stop my friend from trying to force me into doing something that would harm myself, but I also managed to stop her from hurting herself by smoking. "</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "Wonderful, " said James with a big smile, and Kathryn knew that this was her cue to leave. She smiled and thanked him, and left, a huge blanket of relief draped over her.</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "Next! " called James. He sat back in his seat and patiently waited for the third interviewee, with a calm smile on his face.</span>

CHAPTER 3 - ROY

<span style="color: #000000">The third interviewee, Roy, walked in, and bowed his head slightly to James.  "Hi, " he said, nervously, but conversationally.</span>

<span style="color: #000000">James tried to make his nervous guest feel at ease.  "Hello! Sit down, please. "</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Roy sat down, and murmured,  "Thank you. I very much appreciate it. "</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "Now. " started James.  "How do you deal with peer pressure? "</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Roy paused before answering the question. His palms began to sweat, and the back of his neck flamed.  "Umm ...Well, I guess I would stand up against it. It is a very persistent problem, and if everyone learns to be stronger against these ...this ...avalanche ...I mean, avalanche-like situation, they will be strong enough to block peer pressure. "</span>

<span style="color: #000000">James liked Roy's analogies, mainly because he hadn't heard them earlier today.  "Have you ...ever dealt with peer pressure? "</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Roy remembered, distinctly, his high school friend that he knew wouldn't turn out good ...:  "Yes. " Roy replied, confidence increasing.  "Nine years ago, when I was in my senior year of high school, my high school friend offered me some drugs. I didn't want to be addicted, so, naturally, I refused. But my friend was very persistent, and he got angry at me for refusing. He began to try to pressure me, but since I had already built a strong wall, his avalanches only crashed and crumbled to the ground against my wall. Finally, he understood, and stopped. "</span>

<span style="color: #000000">James could visualize the avalanche and the wall.  "Interesting! " he said, quite truthfully.</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Roy bowed his head slightly, the same way he did in the beginning.  "Yes, thank you for taking the time to interview me. "</span>

<span style="color: #000000">He left.</span>

<span style="color: #000000">CHAPTER 4 - THERESA</span>

<span style="color: #000000">Then, the Interviewer called,  "Next! " and the last of the four, named Theresa, walked in.  </span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "Hello, " she said with a smile. She was determined to look confident, and to be presentable.</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "Hello yourself! " said the Interviewer in a jolly voice.  "Please, have a seat. "  </span>

<span style="color: #000000">Theresa sat and smiled. The Interviewer continued.  "How do you deal with peer pressure? "</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "Well, " began Theresa.  "I make sure that the person peer pressuring me understands that I'm refusing to do what they are trying to make me do. I want to be as clear as possible about that statement, and that statement is ...is that ...no one is going to make me do something ...stupid, or something ...that will harm me. I have dealt with peer pressure before: When I was eleven years old, another girl in my grad was trying to make me pull a prank on a teacher that would grant me guaranteed suspension. I refused, because I knew the consequences, and I made it clear to that other girl that I wasn't going to do what she wanted, and I wasn't going to fall into her trap. "</span>

<span style="color: #000000">James smiled. He had just finished interviewing all four interviewees, and he liked all of his responses.</span>

<span style="color: #000000"> "Thank you, " he said, and called out, just as she was about to leave,  "Until next time! "</span>
