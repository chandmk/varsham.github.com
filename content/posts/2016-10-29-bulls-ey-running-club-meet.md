It is better running
  
In the sweet sunning
  
warmth of the sun
  
It would have been more fun
  
Although the cold
  
and don't forget the mold
  
were there 

I tried my best
  
and I could hear my heart pounding loudly in my chest
  
As you should know
  
I've never gotten 1oth or more low
  
When I looked at the place I came in
  
I felt as if I was in a dust bin

But when I saw my time
  
The bells of hope began to chime
  
And I realized I've done better than every other time
