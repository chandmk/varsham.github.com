Hope is Everything 

Seawater Beach was beautiful because the waves gently walked along its mushy border -the sand. Alissa, her mother and their dog Buttercup went along the beautiful beach. Alissa decided to make sand castles. Before they could make a sand castle, the waves suddenly rocked ferociously across it's border.
  
Alissa's dog Buttercup helplessly barked at the long, high, strides of desperate waves. Buttercup yanked the leash out of Alissa's hands and disappeared into the waves.
    
 "Buttercup! Buttercup! Come back! " called Alissa. She started crying. They searched for Buttercup everywhere but they could not find her.  "Calm down Alissa. We will come back to search for Buttercup. " Mother said soothingly.  " Buttercup could die in such ferocious waves! " cried Alissa.
  
 "Don't worry, Alissa.  " said her mother.  "Hope is everything. If you hope, Buttercup will come back to you. "
  
They both kept checking but they could not find their dog, until one day ...
  
When Alissa's family was home, the doorbell rang. As Alissa opened the door she saw Buttercup being carried by a man. The mother asked how they knew it was their dog.
  
The person (the person was named Philip) said,  "I saw your dog go into the waves but before that, I got a good look at the dog and you. I took a picture of both you and the dog. I saw it wash up the shore very sick. I live in your community. I searched and I saw you in this house. And I brought the dog to you. "  "Thank you! " said the mother. Philip gave Buttercup back to Alissa. She thanked Philip. Alissa said  " You were right, Mom. Hope is everything. " They both laughed.
