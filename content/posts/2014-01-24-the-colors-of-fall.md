Orange is the color of the leaves
  
that fall off the trees
  
The pumpkin that are never dull

Red is the color of apples
  
that grow on trees
  
Those same red leaves

Yellow is the color of yummy corn
  
that grow in the fields
  
Surrounded by many trees

Brown is the color of the dry leaves
  
tired of the cold autumn
  
The color of the nests of robins
  
that snuggle in them
