I have a pet frog that has amazing acuity. The frog zeroes in on one of its  "prey "(frog food) and waits until it thinks that the food won't be alert when it catches it. I don't know where my little frog came from, but I like to imagine that during the  "Age of Immigration " a group of immigrants came and had the frog with them. The frog had escaped to the pet shop, and here I am, watching my frog's acuity catch prey. I think my frog is amazing, but when my sister sees my frog, she steps away as if it sheds acrid fumes.  "My frog doesn't acerbate anyone! " I plead to her, but I never understood the motive of her reaction to the frog. Luckily our different opinions don't cause acrimony between us. Actually, there is no reason to be acrimonious about it. After all, people are allowed to disagree with each other.
