Hello, ladies and gentlemen! I am very happy to share an article that I am proudly presenting before you:

_**How Hurricanes Are Named**_

Hurricanes come to us in various different ways. Because of these changes, they get different names. Don't ask me how meteorologists detect the similarity, but they do! First, when a hurricane comes in, they name the hurricane. Boy names and girl names alternate, going back and forth into a pattern. Currently, as I am being informed_ _ there is an alert coming up about a new hurricane. Next time there is a hurricane, the scientists will name the hurricane a boy name since the name of the current hurricane that is striking the Bahamas is Joaquin, which is a girl name. That is not very long, but that is the basic facts. For more information, go to  _**theweatherchannel.com.**_
