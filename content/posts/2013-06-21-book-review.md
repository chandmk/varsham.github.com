The Talented Clementine,    by  Sara Pennypacker and  illustrated  by Marla Frazee

Clementine thinks she has no talent when there is a talent show! Magaret tried to help her in tap dancing, but she could not. How did she get proud of herself,like 100%?

Read the book to find out.

For people who don't think they have talents.
