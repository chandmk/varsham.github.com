In the bright sunlight there were birds flying
  
overhead and with the moonlight the owls
  
spread their wings gracefully.

I am I, I never change but my life does change.
  
I sometimes change and the feeling in me changes.

My feeling is the poet,and now I feel relaxing the
  
relaxing feeling could change into a angry feeling,
  
whatever I do,whatever I help,my feelings keep
  
changing.

When I walk past the breeze I can feel my hair
  
rise up and catch the wind.The trees and the
  
flowers make me shiver just because of the
  
beautiful colors shining in the sunlight.
