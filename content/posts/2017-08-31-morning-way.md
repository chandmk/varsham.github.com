The cicadas make their loud sounds

Doesn't sound like much,

but it still sounds

like something.

The birds chittering their morning songs

Eager to show off their talent

harmonizing.

The wind blowing through those trees

over there,

and they don't sound like much,

But they sound like something,

because they do it the morning way.
