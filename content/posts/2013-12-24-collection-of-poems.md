Colors, the wonderful,
  
Oh! Blue and gray, colors of sea,
  
Little girl enjoys those vast colors,
  
Oh! The earth is a colorful land,
  
All Red? No!
  
Everything is a different color,
  
So bright to make you smile.

Pink is life,
  
I love pink,
  
No pink, So much sadness,
  
Kept at the darkest color.

Blue the bright,
  
Living to be brilliant,
  
Up we go, to the brilliant blue sky,
  
EEK! Blue the beautiful.

Ravens
  
A maryland team,
  
Vow to love our Maryland team,
  
EEK! They won!
  
No cheers when they're done?
  
So cheer up and cheer!

Sing all you want,
  
I love singing!
  
No one gets sad when you sing, they just cheer,
  
 "Great singing! "
