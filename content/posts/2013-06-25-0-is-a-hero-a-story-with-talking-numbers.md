title: 0 is a Hero!- a story with talking numbers
url: /?p=1661

1 heard a constant  "thud, thud " coming from the number 0.
  
1 said to 2, " 0 does not belong here, he belongs to the negatives. Let's throw him out of our group. Pass this message along to the other numbers, 2. "
  
So, the message went on until 10.
  
 "You are right 1, let's do it! YAHOO! " 10 said to 1.
  
 "So throw him out  of this group! He is the leader of the negatives! Don't be late! " So they put 0 out of their group, in a very mean and teasing way.
  
In the night, 10 slept with no good feelings about 0. He was happy that 0 was out of their group, 10 and his crew also thought that 0 was the leader of the negatives, but he was in the 1 to 10 group. The next morning, every number was shocked. 10 became 1! All because 10 needed 0 to become 10. 10 called for 0 and asked him, " Why am I 1, not 10? "
  
 "You are a 1 because 10 has a 0, which is me, and without any 0, there is no 10. "  "How bad we were when we threw you out of our group. Please stay with us. "  "The negatives want me and you want me, so we can share each other. "Thank You! " cried out 10. Since then, 0 came to be in the middle of the negatives and the positives.
