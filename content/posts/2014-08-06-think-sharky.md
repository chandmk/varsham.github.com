Shark's bones are made of cartilage. Our noses and ears are made of the same material. Scales help sharks to move easily through the water. The shark's undersides are dark to blend in with the waters so they can hide from predators and easily catch food. Sharks eat fish, crustaeans, mollusks, plankton, krill, water mammals, and other sharks. Sharks also have a sharp sense of smell that can detect blood for miles, and miles away. These fascinating creature's population is lowering because people are hunting them.

Sharks live in many different kinds of waters, such as shallow waters, shallow waters, costal waters, deep waters, open ocean, salt waters, fresh waters, and brackish waters. Sharks can also reproduce when they're 12 to 15 years old. They give birth to one or two pups at a time. Near after birth, the young sharks swim off to fend for themselves.
