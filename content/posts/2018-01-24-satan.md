I remember a time when we used to have butter,

A time when we used to have cream.

When simple pleasures were as easy as taking a step,

But now, we hide in fear,

Afraid of being discovered by those who hate us.

 

But some are not so lucky,

and they get delivered straight into the hands of Satan,

working in Satan's labor camps,

worked to the death.

 

So we must hide,

From the world dominated by

Satan come down to earth,

Hitler, himself, the tyrannical ruler.
