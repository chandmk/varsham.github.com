The Adventures of Edward Tulane is an awesome book. I think this because of the author's way of moving through the plot- not too fast and not too slow. I also loved the feelings the author put between the lines.

Summary: Edward Tulane was a china rabbit that was owned by a ten year old girl named Abilene. She loved him very much, but the rabbit didn't love her as much as she did. He didn't love her enough. He realizes this when Abilene's family moves and some boys attempt to tease her by tossing the rabbit around. In an attempt to get Edward, Edward is thrown over board.

 

This book was so simple, but packed with a great plot.
