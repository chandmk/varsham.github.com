She escaped from Salem
  
Ever since her mother was a witch to them
  
She never believed in them
  
But they did
  
The people of Salem

She was afraid
  
She was inconsolable
  
for she had loved her mother
  
more than the world itself
  
She was sad and alone
  
An orphan
  
She dreamt
  
in her lonely fort
  
that she could stop
  
the dangerous people of Salem
  
Starting at her youth
  
To stop the superstitious people
  
of Salem
