They didn’t seen a single bear to hunt. Holt Collier, who led Theodore’s assistants, captured a bear. Holt Collier asked Theodore to shoot the bear. But Roosevelt refused. News spread that the president did not obey the people who caught the bear. Clifford Berryman read the news and was inspired and made a cartoon. In the cartoon Collier was holding a bear while Roosevelt refused to shoot it. Clifford’s cartoon was published in the Washington post.Morris Mitchtom and his Rose got an idea of making a stuffed bear. They presented their stuffed bear to President Theodore Roosevelt. They called the bear Teddy’s Bear. Finally it became Teddy bear. Now it is a popular toy for kids and it was given in honor of Roosevelt.
