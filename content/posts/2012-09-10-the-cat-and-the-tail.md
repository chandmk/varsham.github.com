One day, there was a cat, it had no tail. So one day it went to play with it's friends. His friends laughed at him. Then one day a boy came and said I have a horse tail for you. Then the boy sewed carefully on the cats back. Then when the cat was back the other cats jumped with joy and shouted this cat is just like us!
