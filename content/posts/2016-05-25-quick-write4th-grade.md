Dear Little Brother/Sister, (Note: I don’t have a little brother or sister)

You’ve asked me over and over again what a budget is. Well, now I’m here to tell you. First of all, what is a budget? A budget is something that you create that you can use to plan out how you will spend your money. For example, consider that puzzle you’ve always wanted. But you have to consider that you need to get a certain reading book for school. There are the 10 pencils you’ll need for school, and there is the $1 you owe me for helping you with your homework. The book and the pencils each cost $2. The puzzle costs $2. You now have $5. Uh-oh! You don’t have enough money for everything!

That’s where budgets come into play. Without a budget, you wouldn’t really have it clear with what to spend and what not to spend.

Put what your options are onto a piece of paper and cross out the ones that are wants, not needs:

 

Pencils                                                      $2

Book                                                          $2

<span style="text-decoration: line-through">Puzzle                                                        $2</span>

Debt                                                            $1

There! Now you have a budget that you can follow! It will be much easier when you use a budget to spend your money.
