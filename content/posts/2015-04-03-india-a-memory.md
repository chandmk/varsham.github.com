I remember going to India four years ago(I am nine years old). I loved that place because there were so many things to see. The bustling streets aroused my spirits, and the small shops sold awesome things cheap! Sometimes Pedama would let my sister and I buy anything we liked in those small shops.
  
The cars sprouted dust onto the orange-ish roads. I also always hear the cars rumbling on the road. The drivers could also see anyone who was on the road, and because of all that my sister was permitted to walk across the road by herself to buy small things such as bread. I loved my Pedama's house. She could whip up anything in seconds. I love India.
