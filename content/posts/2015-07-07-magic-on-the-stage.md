I jumped for joy when I heard that I would be seeing the middle school play. My sister was not as excited as me, nor my mother. We would be seeing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, a story which I have read for hours for my passion for it was strong. I used to read it so many times, although it was quite a large book.

Finally, I steeped out of the car, releived for the ride seemed to take long.

I ran ahead of my mother and my middle-school sister, who were talking. I finally resisted the urge to open the heavy double doors and set foot inside the cool lobby and sauntered beside my sister. Although my legs were begging to run ahead, I didn’t want to get lost in the large middle school.

As soon as the commotion about the seats settled, the lights dimmed. I kept asking my mother when It would start, but she always answered,”Just wait, Varsha.”

I waited for a long time until the lights above the small stage beightened. I leaned my head against my chair and glued my eyes to the middle of the stage.

Then, the magic began to appear on the stage.
