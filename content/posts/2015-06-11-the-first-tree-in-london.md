The dot grows

The green sprouts emerge from the earth

like reluctant school children

But when the thunder strikes

The lightening lights up the stilled night

Rains pour down

Like constant floods

But the sprouts stay

 

The sprouts grow

into a small tree

like the broccoli that we eat

But then the large winds blow

The tree falters

But it still stands strong

 

 

The roots grow

expanding wider

each week

like one who has faced much but

is still strong

 

Years pass

The tree stands strong

Still young

But then the seeds drop

Small winds carry it

Next to the first tree in London.
