GRANDPA

A worry line

creased Grandpa's weary face

when he left Alexis to her fate

The one who stayed by his side

For all the years to come,

he hoped that she would face it

ALEXIS

I hope

Grandpa'll be all right

Since Denise died

I could not face it

Why me?

Denise

She was so kind

She suffered my pain with me

Until her end

GRANDPA

Grandpa was down

But he knew that Alexis

should have a good living

Although it pained him

to leave her

And it pained him to know that

The time has come.
