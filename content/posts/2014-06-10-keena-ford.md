Keena Ford goes to second grade and wrote down the date wrong. Her teacher, Mrs.Campbell, mistakes her birthday for another date! What is Keena going to do now? Read the book to find out.
  
**I liked this book because it was funny to read what mistakes the spunky main character did.**

  <strong>I did not like this book because it was to short.Â </strong>
