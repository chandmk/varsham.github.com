Dear Maria,

Last summer, my family and friends went to Mount. Kilauea in Hawaii.

Kilauea gave us a long and exercising hike. We stumbled over large roots and spotted colorful leaves and climbed up lots and lots of steps! My favorite part was when I saw the colorful and lengthy pine needles of the coniferous trees I saw. I saw them scattered throughout the whole hike and I can still remember that one pine needle that displayed the first three colors of the rainbow. The red started with an explosion of color, then mellowed out into a pretty, bright, yellow, then at last ended with a fierce, angry orange that made me squint at first sight.

My memory was like a diary. I can still remember all the details vividly in my head. None of the details I experienced were hazy.

Love, Li
