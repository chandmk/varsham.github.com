Dear Maria,

Arteaga(Ar-tee-ga) led Hiram Bingham during part of his long journey to the Lost City of as so he thought was Vilcapampa. Professor Bingham gave Arteaga some coins, and Arteaga led them group of adventurers. First, Arteaga led them through the jungle. The undergrowth was very dense, but at last, they all came through. Next, they had to cross a slim log bridge that had no railings. There was also the Urubamba river, and it thrashed violently under the flimsy bridge. Bingham was so scared because he knew that he could fall in the terrible river. At last, all of them made it through. Next, they had to climb their way through dense jungle. The slopes were slippery and it was so hot! There was also the danger of the fer-de-lance, a very venomous snake. They kept climbing their way through the tangled ropes of jungle. Finally, they all reached the end weary and tired. Then, Arteaga's family fed the exhausted travellers. Finally, Arteaga's son led the troupe to the ruins, and that was when Bingham had found the ruins of Machu Picchu.

From, Li
