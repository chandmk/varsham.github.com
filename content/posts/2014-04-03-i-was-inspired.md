I went to the woods and climbed a tree. I fell down and felt a branch on the bottom of my thigh. Then I fell to solid ground. My sister started gasping while I was moaning. She got mom. My mom took me to the hospital. During all that time, I had my eyes closed. My mother was frantic. After all the healing, I ended up with an artificial leg. I tried walking, but I fell down. I really hurt when I fell down. Both my legs were numb. After 20 minutes of walking practice, I finally started walking. Every step was fear for me. I was so scared to fall down. I walked to my car. Luckily, it was summer. I would be fine the time I got to school. After the whole summer of stumbling and walking, I could jump! I begged my mom to put me in gym groups. Just because of my leg, she always would say one answer,  "No. " After so long, my mom gave up of saying no and put me in gym groups whatever she could find. I was glad of my effort to go to gym. At the end of college, I found an empty seat for Russian Olympics. since I was 15, I was in the Olympics. I won every match, and I was very famous. I am so glad!!!

AFTERWARD
  
I am now 45, and by that wonderful experience, I was inspired. [I did not tell you what had happened to my leg I wanted you to figure out.
