This story is  full of hope and adventure.
  
I like that this is not a no-problem story. I also like that there is  never an obvious solution to the problems.
  
Summary:
  
Minli's family is poor. But when Ba tells tells the story of the Old Man Of The Moon, Minli is determined to help her family to get a fortune. So Minli sets off. During her journey,she meets a fish that can talk, a dragon that is not able to fly, and a powerful king. Will Minli ever find the Old Man Of The Moon? Read the book and find out!
  
As I read this book, I felt that I was in a completely different world. I also felt sad for her because sometimes she had to leave her best friends and family behind. I felt happy for her when she survived dangerous situations, including one that involves deadly poison.
