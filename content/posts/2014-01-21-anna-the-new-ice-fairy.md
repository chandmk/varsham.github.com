Anna went over to the stump where the tree was cut. Anna planted a tree which would grow in a long time. Anna was 6 now, when Anna was 16, Anna's tree was fully grown! Sixteen year old Anna climbed up her tree. she saw a tiny girl with wings.  "Hi! My name is Caroline! We saw you plant us a new home, this tree. "
  
 "I j-j-just wanted to replace th-th-the old tree that-t-t was c-c-c-cut down. "
  
 "There is no need to be afraid. We just thank you. But if you want, you can be an ice fairy. We have none in our land. "
  
 "Oh, Caroline! I would not refuse! I can come on Saturdays and Sundays! "
  
 "That is just what we need. But you need to go to fairy school. "
  
 "What will I learn there? " asked Anna.
   
 "You will learn the magic of ice fairies. Also, I will shrink you to be like us on Saturday fairy school. "
  
 "I will come. My name is Anna. "
  
 "Bye Anna! "
  
 "Bye Caroline! "
  
Anna happily skipped home, very EXCITED TO GO TO FAIRY SCHOOL!
