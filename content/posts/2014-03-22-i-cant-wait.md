I can't wait. I just can't wait!!

I can't wait for spring, which has the beautiful blossoms and the green grass, oh, the green grass!
  
It is as fresh as it can be! The trees have beautiful green leaves! I of course can't wait for those!
  
The happy children run in the open space and cry for outdoor playing at home!
  
Oh, just how can I wait for these wonderful things!

I can't wait for summer, which has so much warmth that keeps me sweaty all day.
  
The delighted children run in the grass which shines like the bright and brilliant sun.
  
The moist grass wets their sneakers and and leaves smudgy grass stains.
  
But oh! How the mothers complain, with their daughters or sons stained all over!
  
They fuss and they scold! But us children, why do we care, with our shoes and clothes dirty?
  
I can't wait for these wonderful things!

I can't wait for fall, with the red and yellow leaves sailing to the ground!
  
I can't wait to beg my mom for pumpkin picking.
  
Or mabye a field trip to Sharp's Farm!
  
I can't wait to see dashing squirrels, bringing nuts everywhere!
  
I can't wait to see animals going southwards, for this is their migrating season!
  
I can't wait, to pull on my favorite jacket, a small size from TimberLand!
  
I can't wait to tie leaves together, and make wonderful bracelets and necklaces!
  
I can't wait for these wonderful things!

I can't wait for winter, with cold snow and snowman builders!
  
I can't wait to go sledding with my brand new sled!
  
I can't wait to play in the snow on off school days
  
I am so excited!
  
I can't wait for these wonderful things!
