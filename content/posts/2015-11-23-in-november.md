In November, I smell the pine cones that have fallen from the tees, with their flaps sticky with sap.

In November, I see the long branches towering above me, and piles of leaves- red, green, yellow and brown- beneath my feet.

In November, I feel the melting ice cold frost dripping through my fingers.

In November, I taste the juicy turkey and the delicious mouth-watering taste of the pumpkin pie.

In November, I hear the jaunty autumn wind rustling through the pine needles and the leafless branches of the trees.
