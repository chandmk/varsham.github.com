The scent of onions in the air
  
She peers in to the pot
  
And times everything right
  
What is she making?
  
No one knows
  
Something different gets added to the pot
  
Adding different smells to the mix
  
It weaves around me like music
  
Leading me into another world
  
Then, at last in ends
  
And I see it all
  
on my dinner plate.
