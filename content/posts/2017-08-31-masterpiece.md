The rich deep blue

is a masterpiece.

As if an artist is weaving a large brush over his endless canvas.

Or the sunset yellows, or bright orange,

whichever the artist chooses

is shown to all of Earth at different times.

The darker night

dotting the bluish-black sky

with the delicacy of stars

lighting up the night.

Whichever the artist chooses,

it is a masterpiece.

Whether it is the rising sun penetrating the once dark blue

of the skies

Whether the sun sets,

giving off its brilliant colors,

Whichever the artist chooses,

it is a masterpiece.

The sky is his canvas,

and the sky is the limit.
