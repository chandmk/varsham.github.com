Once upon a time

there was talk of tales of great princesses and princes

advancing forward like an army condensed into one

fighting a demon and winning.

Once upon a time

there was an eleven-year-old girl named Arlene

cowering back in fear watching  _them_

walk our streets with blank, cold eyes as if they were one of us.

But they will never be one of us.

 

Once upon a time

such meaningless words that once had meaning

before the soldiers walked in with their

 

 

big boots and their cold stare and their rough hands

Once upon a time

There was an eleven-year-old Jewish girl named Arlene

Hated for who she is

And the Star of David hanging from her neck.

Knowing that she will soon be abandoned in the rough hands

of the Children of Satan

And maybe Satan himself.
