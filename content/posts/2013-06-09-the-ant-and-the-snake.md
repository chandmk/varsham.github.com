One day in India, when there was no food,when there was a tiny cup with 7 grains of rice,lived one tiny ant. When he was strolling along the dry roads of India, a snake came up to him and said,  "Eat the sssseven grainsss of ricessssss without asssissstacessss. " The snake's name was Kaan. As soon as he strolled away, the ant gobbled up some grains of rice. Then he said to himself, "I will eat some rice tomorrow when Kaan won't see me. " The next day, Kaan was fighting a raccoon. The ant quickly ate some rice. After the attack, Kaan saw the ant and sang,  " Oh ant! come over here! " The fooled ant came and Kaan cornered the ant. Then he sang a beautiful tune.This hypnotized the ant. Then Kaan gobbled him up.

THE END

Moral: Don't get fooled by someone. They could hurt you.
