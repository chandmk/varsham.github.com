 "Anna, you may play outside. " called Anna's mother.
  
Anna ran out of the house and climbed up the tree. She was a fairy once again.
  
 "Anna, I am Caroline. There is this bad person who tries to make heat all the time. You need to help. She will MELT if you get her. "
  
 "Oh, Caroline. I am scared, but I will try my best. "
  
A black horse galloped into the land, making fire footsteps. Anna backed away so she wouldn't be melted. SHe made a trail of ice. The ugly woman on the horse was all covered all over except her face. Anna could see she had horns. As the horse stepped on the ice trail, it died. The wretched woman made a lava trail so she could walk. Anna was terribly frightened, so she made extra cold water and threw it on the woman. But she came alive again!
  
 "Make ice flowers and defeat me. "
  
Then, she clapped her hands around her mouth. Anna made an ice flower. But before she could throw it, the woman DISSAPEARED. Anna saved her flower so she could defeat the woman. She put it on her ice ground.
  
 "Thank you for trying, Anna. Now she will come on the days your coming.  "
  
ANNA WENT HOME, SAYING BYE, FEELING VERY DISAPPOINTED.
