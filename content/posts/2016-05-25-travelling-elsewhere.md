**Chapter 1
  
** Cinthia Adams glanced with uncertainty at her 6 year-old sister Linn Adams defiantly held up the strange-looking toy. It had 4 arms, 2 on either side, and it had scarecrow legs and an orange face. On the face was a neatly carved nose, eyes, and mouth. On the body of the robot was strange writing. Cinthia, who took Spanish and French at school did not know what it meant. Her certitude was unsteady as she naturally took charge:  "All right, Linn. Here's the dollar bill. "

At the check-out counter, the clerk stared quizzically at the 11 year-old and her 6 year-old sister.  "Are you- " The clerk was cut off by a loud yelling. definitely of a prissy lady. Sure enough, there was a woman behind them, clattering with her high heels to the clerk. Her hand was raised as if she was going to slug him.   The clerk must have thought so to, because he hid his face with his hands.

Instead she began screaming,  "You didn't give me enough change! I want my change! I am going to sue you! You just give me all my change and maybe I'll spare you, you ...you-! "

Cinthia grabbed her little sister's hand and together they walked out to home. Their mother and father left for work  in early morning  and came back very late. Luckily the shop was very close to their home so they only had to walk home.

At home, Linn begged her older sister to play with her new robot toy. If that pestering wasn't enough, she begged to play with her. Cinthia sighed and followed Linn  in to her room. She fingered the little pocket knife in her auburn-colored bun. Her uncle had given it to her, and Cinthia had always put it in her hair as a memory of that uncle she so loved.

 "Come on! " Linn said impatiently.  "Look! A button! "

Linn fingered the button. She had this aching urge to press it, but she knew that her overprotective sister would stop her. Finally, her curiosity gave in.

Cinthia was about to warn her younger sister from pressing that red button, but in a blink of an eye Linn had pressed it.

**Chapter 2**

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Cinthia woke up. Her head was throbbing, her long waist-length hair strewn all over the rock her head was lying on. Somehow her bun had come out. Cinthia got up to her feet and stretched. Where was she? Just then, her sister Linn woke up. Cinthia helped her sister to her feet.  The two sisters surveyed their surroundings. In all directions there was barren wastelands. The sisters walked forward in one direction. They held hands. Neither complained, although their legs hurt. Both of them knew that they had to get home from this place. But how? Then, after a long time, they saw a large box. It was as big as a football field. The door was closed. Cinthia realized that this was a lead. A lead to home. It simply had to be. She let go of her sister's hand and strode further towards the door. Cinthia was frightened, but nevertheless she flung open the door.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Cinthia pulled her sister in the box. There were people everywhere. They had chains attached to their necks which were attached to hooks in the wall. Their hands were bound together by a lengthy amount of chain. So were their legs. There were six prisoners. Two children, four adults. Suddenly, out of the blue, the two sisters heard a voice. It was the voice of a pained man:  "Why are you here? .... " His voice trailed off.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  <strong>Chapter 3</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  A withered white hand reached for the girls.  The white hand stretched further and further. Cinthia scooted aside from the white hand. More voices began to fill the room. They began to swim around Cinthia:  "Grab ze knife, Thom*, grab ze knife! "                           *Thom is pronounced Tom
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
   "Leave them alone! "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Soon the voices began to blend together. Cinthia floated into a strange dreamlike phase. Suddenly, all of the noise in the room stopped. Cinthia snapped back to a more alert phase. She said, shielding her sister with her body:  "You can't just steal. Why are you doing this to us? "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Suddenly, a younger man shouted in a French accent:  "Oh no! Ze Boss! Ze Boss! "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Cinthia's face contorted into that of a confused person. Suddenly the two sisters felt a giant, beefy, hand pull them backward. They both screamed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  <strong>Chapter 4</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
   "Vot are you doing here? " the booming voice that was asking this was quite frightening, and neither of the girls were inclined to answer this giant beast of a man.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
   "Answer me! Vot are you doing here! "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  A young woman prisoner, about in her mid-twenties, was thinking. Long auburn hair spilled on her shoulders. Her green eyes widened as she thought. How to save these lovely children? She was a single mother, and her newborn baby died. This made her want to save these children. She thought, and then, she thought of the strangest but most effective solution. She began singing  "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  The beefy man looked up, the tiniest hint of fear in his big green eyes. This evil giant man had been good once. He heard that tune, and he took off, away from the box of prisoners. He was going, going, gone.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  The man was definitely not an athletic figure. Several times had he stumbled when her looked back over his massive shoulder to check if these sinister ones were following him. The prisoners had a good laugh after a long time.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  <strong>Chapter 5</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Linn began to ask a question. They stopped laughing immediately because they knew that these children were newcomers, and they would have lots of questions. Linn asked, "Why did he run away? "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  The young woman who had saved their lives stepped forward the best she could with that  <em>thing  </em>around her neck and said, "Hello, little dears. I am Mellia. The Yodels sing like that. "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Linn began to open her mouth to ask what Yodels were, but when she saw that Mellia was still speaking she closed it.  "I suppose you are going to ask what Yodels are, weren't you, my dear? " she said, aiming gray eyes at the little girl. Linn in return, fixed bright blue eyes on the older woman and nodded.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Mellia started talking again:  "Yodels are big birds. One full-grown Yodel is 1/2 of a Yeldan. A Yeldan is, well- We're Yeldans! This planet is called Yelda. It's called Yelda because that's what the first Yodel said. They sing Twinkle, Twinkle when they found something they didn't like. The big man who was yelling at you, that's Phob. He's our ruler. He calls himself The Boss. He had a sister named Phobia, but he killed her for power as king. She was supposed to be queen. She was a good Yeldan. " The prisoners bowed their heads in sadness. There was a long pause.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Mellia snapped her fingers weakly and began talking again:  "The Yodels hate injustice, so they have vowed to kill The Boss. They have not succeeded yet. But soon, the Yodels will evolve and they won't make any noise when they come across something they hate.  "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
   "I think that we should introduce. Introduce yourselves, and then we'll introduce the six of us. " Mellia was also a natural leader.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Cinthia introduced both of them:  "My name is Cinthia. I am 11 years-old. My sister here is Linn. She is 6 years-old. "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Mellia nodded. The introducing began:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
     "I am Oscar. Mellia is my mother. " Mellia smiled fondly at her son.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
     "I am Rosegail. You can call me Rose or Gail. Or Rosegail. "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
     "I am Peony. "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
     "Thom. "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
   "I'm Lailac. My daughter's Rose. "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
   " I'm Rudolph. Sort of like the reindeer, eh? "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  The prisoners laughed. Cinthia smiled along with Linn.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Cinthia pulled the Swiss Army knife out of her hair. She had found that the knife had been tangled in her hair the whole time. She sawed at the chains, and soon, the prisoners were free.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Then, Mellia realized something.  "Oh! " she said.  "The Yodels have a fallback: a disease. It's called Leedo. Yodel backwards, without the &#8216;y'. There is a cvure, but there isn't usually time to use it.  " Cinthia's brown eyes then showed pure happiness. It was clear that she had a plan. They huddled together, discussing about it. If the robot had brought them, then it would bring them back, wouldn't it?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  <strong>Chapter 6</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  The troop of people walked out of the box quietly, heavily armed with the sawed out chains.<br />  "How do we summon the Yodels? " Cinthia whispered.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Suddenly, Rudolph let out a wild call. He whooped once again, and they began to see yellow snouts appearing everywhere. The eyes were dark brown, and One half of their bodies were rather like a seahorse. The bottom half of the Yodel was just a fist wide tail that gotten thinner and thinner.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Cinthia could feel Peony's long black braids touching her back as the tall woman touched the girl's shoulder. Cinthia gulped and stepped forward.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
   " Yodels, we are trying to kill Phob. We have a plan. "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  The Yodels stayed stone faced while Cinthia explained the plan. After Cinthia had finished explaining, the biggest Yodel began to make a sound like a wolves howl.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  The rest of the clan took up the same call. Then, the biggest Yodel stepped out of the crowd of Yodels. He raised a yellow wing. The howling stopped.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
   "My clan likes this plan. We shall accompany you. "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  <strong>Chapter 7</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  The earthlings, Yeldans, and Yodels all his behind the bushes, watching Phob's palace. It was a magnificent thing. The Yodels took turns flying up to the window. Just then, Cinthia  realized that it was night. That was her flaw! She hasn't planned when they would come to the palace. She clutched the bottle of Leedo germs tighter. Then she realized that it was the time when Phob was sleeping. Cinthia's shoulders relaxed . At last came her time to come to the palace. She rode a Yodel. The Yodel efficiently opened the window. Cinthia  climbed in. Meanwhile, Linn was dropped off in a room that she had seen the robot in. Linn slowly slid off the Yodel. She felt as if she was ankle-deep in wet cement. She had just slowly curled her fingers around the robot when she heard an anguished wail. It was of her sister's.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  <strong>Chapter 8</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Linn ran towards the wail. When she got there, she saw Phob. Phob was strangely wrinkled. He had a bloated wrist. He had died. Linn knew this because his chest was not rising and falling. Then, Linn ran over to the other side of the bed. There was her sister, on the floor. She had a bloated wrist. The skin around her wrist was strangely wrinkled.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Cinthia said feebly to her stunned her sister,  "Tell mom and dad that I love them. "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Tears began filling Linn's eyes. Then she made two war whoops. The Yodels and the prisoners came along with the Yodels. Then, voices began to swim around the two girls. They both could feel a hot liquid being poured on them. Linn fumbled for the robot, and then pressed the button.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  The girls cleared their minds. then, they heard another voice:  "Girls! Time for dinner! Dad's already down here! "
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
