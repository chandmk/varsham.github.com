I picked up my mother's dolphin decoration. I didn't know why it was here when it was first standing on my mom's nightstand. It was so eerie. suddenly, the grass grew up and up until it towered over me. I slipped inside the hole at the bottom of the dolphin. I was almost fully inside until my mom picked it up. I grew frantic. I did not get enough time! I clung desperately to the edge of the hole.  "Athena!!! Where are you? " That was my mother. Finally, she set the dolphin on the porch. I struggled to get in the hole as she put it down, but somehow I managed to get in. But when I was in the dolphin, I got really scared. I am only 9 years old, and even I am afraid of the dark. I tapped on the rock of the dolphin, and a crack came. Carefully, I climbed through the crack. For some reason, I saw some dancers dancing around. I realized that I was in Ireland! Why was I here? Is it a quest, or a serious mission? While all that questioning and thinking, a person jumped in front of me. A person with wings? No. I am just imagining. But I really saw wings!   I was quite startled when the fairy jumped in front of me, so I jumped back and tittered.    "Now, Now. There is no use of tittering now, " said the fairy.  "We are the shee! The fairies that the Irish believe in! "      "So ... ..... You are a f-f-f-fairy? "  "Of course! My name is Gwendolyne, Uh ..... What's yours?  "Athena. " I replied, feeling much more confident. Gwendolyne whistled, and 5 other fairies came.  "This is Abby, Kate, Kathrine, June, and Josefina.  " I stared. I looked behind my shoulder. I saw something flap.  "You have wings! " trilled June. I moved my shoulders front and back, and instantly, I was in the air!  "You are flying! " said Kate, gasping. I flew down.  "Why am I here? " I asked.  "You are here because we have chosen you to fight witches. They have been invading Ireland for many decades. "

Gwendolyne's wings drooped as she talked. My wings also drooped. The other five fairies &#8216; wings drooped too.  "And she is here right now. "

A cascade of black drops dropped in front of the dolphin. All at once, I hid behind a fat tree in the tree groove.  "Here is a book of spells! " called Gwendolyne. I flipped through the book and saw a disappearing spell.  "ADIA! GADIA! SADIE! SADIE! TAMIA!  " The witch instantly disappeared. I came out of my hiding place. I was panting. Tension had entered. I fell to the ground.  "Athena? Athena!  " said Gwendolyne. I woke up.  "I made the witch disappear! " I said as I sat up.

 "Thank you! You may go home. "

I climbed in the dolphin and I climbed out of the crack. I grew taller, and I went to my room. I took out my diary. But suddenly, I realized that dinner was not served. The time had not passed! I wrote this adventure in my diary if I hold the dolphin, I would shrink.
