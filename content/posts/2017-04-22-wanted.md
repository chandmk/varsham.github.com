She's run from our town,

bad child.

Stop any means of transport

and look for her!

Where has she one?

If you've seen any sight of her;

a fragment of her ripped white robe,

or a strand of her jet-black hair.

Anything is accepted. Anything at all!

Now that she has gone,

war-lovers rejoice, belligerent people laugh;

laughing at our tears, and laughing at our fear to speak aloud

of our loss.

So have you seen her? Any trace?

For her name is Peace.
