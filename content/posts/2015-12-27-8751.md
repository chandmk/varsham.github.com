My feet are pounding

Terrible aches pass through them

I feel like stopping

But I keep trying

My hair flies behind me

My arms are swinging back and forth, lazily

Feeling like lead

I feel like stopping

But I keep trying

My ears are listening

To the constant rhythm

Of the pounding of my feet

I feel like stopping

But I keep trying

My eyes are trained to the gravel path

Watching closely for obstacles

I feel like stopping

But I keep trying

At last comes my triumphant end,

That I had only achieved,

by perseverance.
