I was so small then
  
But I did know
  
Father
  
Just grabbing his suitcase
  
Out the door
  
To the world
  
Where I could never find him
  
I looked at Mother
  
A tear rolling down her cheek
  
I could tell
  
It was a tear of sadness mixed with anger
  
I ran upstairs
  
Sobs bursting out
  
Years passed
  
A ring from the doorbell
  
We've haven't had one in ages
  
I opened the door
  
Saw a man
  
He looked familiar
  
I knew who it was
  
But I could not move
  
Not able to do anything
  
 "Father! "
  
I murmur
  
That was the key
  
To the chains that held me
  
I hugged my Father
  
like the Father I have always loved
  
I forgave him
  
He looked into my gray eyes,
  
saying
  
 "I love you Jocelyn. "
