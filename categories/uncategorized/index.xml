      <description>I think that unhealthy school lunches should not be allowed because they can cause diabetes. This disease does not have cure and it is developed by obesity. Obesity is developed from the eating of fried or oily foods, such as the foods in Haley&amp;rsquo;s cafeteria.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anna was up the tree, she heard Caroline saying, &amp;ldquo;Spin three times to go to your adventure. &amp;rdquo; Anna spun three times and in a long time (She is in a whirlwind and it takes long time). Anna read the sign, SNOW-ATOM ADVENTURE FOR ICE! . Anna ran along and saw some Ice Controls. She made a mountain which broke them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She then came across a monster. It said, &amp;ldquo;I am Marmalade! I love ice fairies! &amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are Heat? &amp;rdquo; asked Anna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, &amp;rdquo; answered Marmalade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna made an ice sheet and shot it to Marmalade. When the ice quickly melted, Marmalade died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna was surprised to see some more Ice Controls. Again, she made a mountain to destroy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, she cried,  &amp;ldquo;I want to go back to Fairyland! I wish I could! &amp;rdquo; In a whirl wind, Anna was laying on a bed of leaves. She woke up to find her friend Caroline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You are safe from your adventure. Always remember your adventures with Marmalade. You are so brave! I am proud of you! &amp;rdquo; said Caroline.&lt;/p&gt;
