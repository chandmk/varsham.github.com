      <description>She&amp;rsquo;s run from our town,
bad child.

and look for her!
Where has she one?
If you&amp;rsquo;ve seen any sight of her;
a fragment of her ripped white robe,</description>

when each took their side,
Soldiers were enlisted</description>

      <description>Love
A wonderful thing indeed,
Unable to be shown
Can only be expressed
But there is a deeper meaning for love
That secret is the love between family
And the never-ending love</description>

Poems are made because of the ideas
Poems are made to remember the forgotten things
Poems are made to burst out your happiness and make peace
Poems are made to stop the miserable things that come in your heart</description>

Oh Joe, please don&amp;rsquo;t ride that again.</description>

      <description>In the bright sunlight there were birds flying
overhead and with the moonlight the owls
spread their wings gracefully.
I am I, I never change but my life does change.</description>
