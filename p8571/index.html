	<p>Annelise was an orphan. She was kind and loved animals. Her mother, who had died a long time ago from a sickness, was so kind, too. Everyone mourned at her death.</p>

<p>Her father had built her the house she lived in currently before he collapsed on his   deathbed and died. Weeks after the house was built, people looking for places to build their houses got attracted to the little house and built their houses right there. That was how Seasideville was created.</p>

<p>At his house, the mayor paced back and forth. “The people are bored,” he declared to his friend, the general. “They want books! I will establish a writing contest for Seasideville and the winner will officially be an author.”</p>

<p>“A commendable idea, my friend! I will pass out the news using the newspaper.” So that came to pass.</p>

<p>Annelise was so excited as she read and reread the exciting news. Her gray-blue eyes widened, and she absentmindedly tucked her black hair behind her ear. A writing contest in Seasideville!   For the first time! Annelise got so excited that she saved up some money and the very next day, she had already bought the writing supplies!</p>

<p>Annelise soon went about mending a dress for herself and she tidied the house as if she was going to get guests.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, outside, a group of workers were moving furniture, lamps, and many other elegant house appliances into the empty house next door. Annelise never paid much attention to that house, and this was almost the first time thinking about it. Annelise looked out of the window and saw the new neighbors. She recognized them immediately!</p>

<p>They were bullies from her elementary school. They had been in the same school as her in all of her years, and they never stopped teasing her. Colette had always followed her home from her school, and Emma had always been loyal to Colette. Annelise had been teased because she was much more smaller and smarter than them. Shaking away these horrid thoughts, Annelise went back to her work. But she did not completely stray from those thoughts. She closed every small gap in her house so that the bullies wouldn’t see her. This made the room quite dark, so she lit an oil lamp and continued mending her dress.</p>

<p>Weeks passed, and the bullies soon came to know about Seasideville’s writing contest. They started mending their dresses and also, finding out Annelise lived next to them, they used some of her help. But they didn’t bother to say thank you at all.</p>

<p>A few days later,(although quite suddenly) an earthquake struck while Annelise was outside, playing in the warm waves. She saw the old house that her father built teeter, then fall, but the bullies’ house stayed upright and resisting. She knew she could do nothing about it. Annelise burst into tears and sank into a soaking heap.</p>

<p>After Annelise’s tears had subsided, the bullies tricked Annelise into living in their house. But they treated her badly. Annelise felt terrible, but also felt it wise to keep quiet about it.</p>

<p>Finally, the writing night had arrived. The two bullies dressed into fancy dresses and even had a decorated binder to put their writing in. As they walked away, tossing their heads about and telling all sorts of things, Annelise burst into tears once more, inconsolable. After several minutes she said to herself bitterly, “I deserve to go to that writing night as much as they do!”   She sat down on the shore, the hot sand warming her cold feet, the water lapping at her still body. The water was warm and comforting.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a bird swooped out from nowhere. Annelise ducked her head in surprise. Then, she saw a flash of bright red that made her squint her eyes. It was a cardinal! Cardinals in Seasideville, Ocean City? The cardinal sang a high-pitched song that went:</p>

<p>Annelise, Full of kindness</p>

<p>Annelise, We will help you</p>

<p>If it so pleases you.</p>

<p>“How will you help me?” asked Annelise. Her head started to spin. The cardinal chirped a high note which changed the old dress that Annelise was mending. It was now a beautiful green dress, with real emerald jewels and there were also emerald slippers included! Tears of gratitude shone in her eyes, and then the bird did what you could call a bow, or at least what the bird thought was a bow.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a humongous frog(twenty times as big as a normal frog) hopped into the bullies’ house, returned with their fabulous writing supplies(a calligraphy pen and a shiny black ink in a clear-colored jar), and it flattened itself out before the confused girl to serve as a desk. The bird sang words to her, and then in no time Annelise had created a perfect writing piece. Annelise smiled and thanked them. But before Annelise could take even one step, the bird had flew in front of her. “Wait, my dear girl! Let me give you a warning! You have to return right after you read the piece. If you don’t, the dress will fall off and you will only be dressed in your old wincey dress, and your emerald slippers will be replaced by your bare feet. ” Annelise promised and walked away happily, the warning in mind.</p>

<p>When Annelise arrived, she was the last person to take a slot in the contestant list. Everyone went until it was time for Annelise to read her story. Everyone loved it, especially the mayor. But what took him by surprise was that she had ran off right after the piece. The mayor tried going after her but she was too fast for him. He sadly sat down, deep in thought of how to get that girl with the shining gray-blue eyes and jet black hair who wrote that beautiful piece. Then, a bell went off in his head!</p>

<p>The mayor told everyone that participated in the contest to enter their name and their story or poem or sonnet in his website. Annelise fearfully entered because a threat had accompanied the command.</p>

<p>Then, the next day, the mayor checked his website. As soon as he glanced at the first word of Annelise’s piece he knew that she was the person who wrote the piece because he had remembered that piece so well. The mayor asked everyone where Annelise lived, and even placed WANTED signs on freshly built poles(Seasideville was quite big and was still prospering) and she was eventually found. Annelise’s tan face turned bright red when she was found and she stepped reluctantly forward using the Mayor’s lead. Annelise’s embarrassment lessened when the mayor read her piece out loud to himself, and she felt so good. Annelise had finally fulfilled her dream: to be an author.</p>
