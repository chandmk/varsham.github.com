    <p>Everyone loved Robert, who could play the flute so beautifully and make his fingers fly and his legs dance, and Robert’s twin sister Darlene always welcomed the children that would drift towards his house to hear him play. He was the brightest silver lining our town ever had.</p>

<p>Robert was a friend of my mother, ever since we had moved here. He had cheered me up with his songs when I was sad, and he made Katie’s and my life as sweet as chocolate. But after that, since Robert had enlisted in the army just before, he had been sent away on a minor war mission, and this changed our life, for we knew we missed Robert and his music.</p>

<p>A month later, Katie said to me: “Maura, have you noticed that Darlene doesn’t get any mail?”</p>

<p>I had to think about it for a second, but before I could reply, the bell rang, and we had to rush to our classrooms.</p>

<p>After school, I met Katie in front of Darlene’s house, and when we knocked on her door, and she graciously waved us in. She set a plate of cookies on the coffee table in her living room, went to the kitchen, then came back and settled down on a large couch in front of us. I reached out for a cookie. It was warm to touch, and Darlene seemed to have made it just before we arrived. Then, Katie said, “Have you heard anything from Robert?”</p>

<p>Darlene’s normally pleasant features dropped and she said, “No, I haven’t.”</p>

<p>She sighed, and after a long silence in which neither of us said anything, she smiled again and said, “But I imagine he must be very busy.” Then, with no more mention of Robert, she offered us some more cookies, and then we left, very concerned about him.</p>

<p>At school, Katie and I began to learn the flute, and when we first tried playing the flute, we sounded terrible, and neither of us could keep up a good sound for a long time. Still, it was fun to try.</p>

<p>Several months later, Katie and I were both much better, although we still could not keep our sound going for very much longer. We had prayed for a long time for Robert, and in fact, it had become our daily routine.</p>

<p>After I uttered a few prayers, I left for school, and since it was a band day, I brought my flute and met Katie at the bus stop. She had brought her flute as well, and during band lessons, for a few moments, I felt my fingers fly, and the sound that came out of my flute seemed quite beautiful.</p>

<p>On the way home, Katie and I saw Darlene, standing in front of her house, but we could not see her expression clearly until we drew closer. Then, we saw she was crying, and she said softly, “Read this.”</p>

<p>I took the letter from her and held it between Katie and me, and we began to read:</p>

<p>Robert Newland was killed in action in July 9th, 2011.” I dropped the letter. The words just did not make sense to me, and when I actually understood, I just stood there, petrified in shock. Then, Katie the next part aloud: “His will is enclosed here:</p>

<p>Maura Liltings and Katie Fischer will get my two extra flutes, both unused &hellip;”</p>

<p>Darlene smiled sadly and said, “That’s you both! ”</p>

<p>Then, she abruptly went inside her house, but Katie and I didn’t leave. Instead, we sifted through the will, and when I saw my mother’s name, I found she got a phonograph.</p>

<p>Darlene then returned, but this time with the flutes, and I blew into mine the second I had it, but found that an object was obstructing its sound, and after some poking and prodding, I got it out, and I found it was a note that said, “To Maura, who stuck with me till the very end.” I read the note aloud, and Darlene hugged me and went inside.</p>

<p>My mother brought Katie and me to the funeral, and I no longer felt sad or shocked about Robert’s death, for I felt as if I could take on any hardship, any challenge.</p>

<p>During the funeral, my mind drifted off as beautiful, poetic words about Robert were said, and I thought of Robert’s favorite things, such as music and children. Music had lightened Robert&rsquo;s heart in his darkest hour, and he turned to songs when he was sad, and as I continued pondering this, the funeral was brought to an end.</p>

<p>I knew Robert&rsquo;s fingers would never fly, and his legs would never dance again, and I knew I would always miss him.</p>
