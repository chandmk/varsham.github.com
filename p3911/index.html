    <p>Anne Macolly was a magician. She had a wand. One day, she was thinking about what she wanted. She figured out. &ldquo;I want something, just something magical. &rdquo; Anne thought to herself, what magic words would make her magical thing.  &ldquo;AHBEEPREEGAW! &rdquo; Yelled Anne. That was her magic words. Then suddenly a sparkling blue car appeared before her. Her gasp was heard by a man dressed in black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a nice place to rest. The seats are very comfy and cozy. Good car. &ldquo;</p>

<p>The man said to Anne,  &ldquo;I am the magician, you got all your magic from. Put the wand at your house. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. &rdquo; replied Anna in a very upset tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Getting that wand everyday, eh? Now you have to stop that. Magic is only used for saving people, not for people who are selfish. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not selfish, and go away. &rdquo; Yelled Anne.</p>

<p>So, the man in the black dress vanished. Anne saw that her hand were empty.</p>

<p>Then she realized that she should not care about herself only, she should care about other people as well.</p>
