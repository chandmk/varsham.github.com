<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Red Scarf Girl: Coming of Age</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Red Scarf Girl is an autobiography of a young girl, Ji-Li Jiang, who spent ten years of her life living during the terrifying years of the Cultural Revolution. She lived under a leader, Chairman Mao, who brought peasants to power and rich people to their knees. Unfortunately, this created a divide, and people grew miserable. This misery sometimes even led to suicide. Ji-Li came of age during the Cultural Revolution, and she lost her innocence in many ways. The Cultural Revolution compelled Ji-Li to come of age because she lost innocence when she realized that the Cultural Revolution was bad, and she matured when she chose family over the Revolution.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, Ji-Li was very excited to be a part of the Cultural Revolution. She believed strongly in Chairman Mao. She wanted to be a Red Guard, a strong supporter of Chairman Mao, one of the soldiers who had changed China, and was very excited about it: “My friends and I had grown up with stories of the brave Revolutionaries who had changed China.”(Jiang 28) Ji-Li was very innocent at the beginning of the novel, with no idea of how harsh the Revolution really was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Later, Ji-Li began to feel sorry for the people who were opposed during the Revolution, and she thought the Red Guards’ punishment were rather unnecessary. Even so, Ji-Li still believed in Chairman Mao. When she saw a man get punished for not lending a Red Guard his bicycle, a small part of Ji-Li felt sorry for him: “I felt sick to my stomach. I went back inside. It was all terribly unnecessary. He was so determined, but so wrong.”(Jiang 110) Little by little, Ji-Li was learning the truth about the Revolution through the terrible punishments that the people around her went through, and she slowly began to lose her innocence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, Ji-Li realized that the Cultural Revolution was not what she thought it was. She saw more and more flaws about it, and she began to see the truth. When she was younger, she was taught to treasure Chairman Mao above her own family. But, when she grew older, she learned that she did not agree with Chairman Mao on this matter. She learned this when she was asked to testify against her father, and to side with Chairman Mao, but she refused, because, firstly, her father had not done anything wrong, and second, Ji-Li could not just leave her family: “I would never do anything to hurt my family, and I would do everything I could to take care of them. My family was too precious to forget and too rare to replace.”(Jiang 262) At the end of the novel, Ji-Li learned that the Cultural Revolution was not what she expected it to be. She, unlike the supporters of Chairman Mao, learned to choose family above all, and she did not regret her choice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the end of the novel, Ji-Li matured by really understanding the true intentions of the Red Guards supporting Chairman Mao and the Cultural Revolution. She also lost her innocence by realizing that the world would not always hold successes for her, and Chairman Mao was not always right. Before, Ji-Li used to love the Cultural Revolution, and she even had a dream of becoming a Red Guard. But later, Ji-Li began to feel unsure about the Revolution, and then, she realized that the Revolution was actually hurting innocent people. This included her family, and she decided that she would care for her family no matter what Chairman Mao said. She did not believe in the Cultural Revolution anymore.</span></p>
