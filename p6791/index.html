<h5 id="chapter-1-the-beginning">CHAPTER 1-THE BEGINNING  ♣</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  It the far away lands of Leafland, there live a little girl named Arenelle. Arenelle was a little girl by the age of 9. At night Arenelle always heard her parents talking about someone named Marielle. Arenelle never paid attention to this, but little did she know that Marielle was a lost sister of hers. Finally, when Arenelle turned 11, her parents revealed the painful secret.
</p>

<p>“Arenelle, come here. We must tell you something that you must not reveal to anyone.” called the parents. Arenelle willingly came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is this person called Marielle- &ldquo;</p>

<p>“I know about Marielle. I heard you talking about it at night.” Arenelle then regretted what she had said, because her parents seemed very taken aback. Arenelle hung her head in guilt.<br />
“Oh, Arenelle,” told her  parents, soothingly.”Were expecting that you would do that. That action is understandable for a 11-year-old.” Arenelle, relieved that she had been forgiven brightened up her spirits.</p>

<p>“Marielle is your long-lost sister.” Arenelle’s parents revealed, directly.</p>

<p>“Why haven’t you told me this before?” asked Arenelle angrily.</p>

<p>“We didn’t mean for you to-”</p>

<p>“I’ve been hearing this Marielle talk without knowing her for years! Why couldn’t you reveal this before? She is my own sister! I am supposed to know her, and you don’t tell me anything about her!” Arenelle ran away from her surprised parents and ran into her room, slamming the door. Arenelle finally calmed down. Then, she had a brilliant idea. Arenelle ran to her parents and stated 5 words:</p>

<p>“I’m going to find Marielle.”</p>

<p>“No Arenelle! Come back! Don’t go! Please!” But Arenelle as already ready. “I’m going, and that’s that.”</p>

<p>CHAPTER 2- MEETING SKYLARK  ♣</p>

<p>Arenelle was well into the woods, not knowing where she was going to end up. But Arenelle was determined to find that so-called sister of hers.</p>

<p>Finally she was in a town’s square. She walked around it, hoping to find someone. Suddenly, she heard a quiet sound behind her. A lizard! The lizard had a red tail, yellow feet, orange face, and a green body. <em>Queer lizard,</em> thought she.</p>

<p>“Hey don’t you go on thinkin’ like that, little girl! I read minds!”</p>

<p>Arenelle, surprised that the lizard could talk and read minds, replied, <em>Sorry lizard, I did not know,</em> “Tsal’ right litlle girl. I’ll send ya a message!” replied the lizard. Suddenly, some words popped into her mind. Arenelle knew she had the message. The message read, <em>What is your name? My name is Skylark. Don’t make fun of it,yar! My mother named me Skylark thinkin’ that I was a girl.</em> Arenelle was amazed. They read each other’s messages without speaking! <em>Wow! You can do it too! My name is Arenelle!</em> Replied Arenelle.“Everyone thought that too when they met me.” Skylark said out loud. “What happened to them?” asked Arenelle. “They died, cause’ of careless mistakes they’d made.” Arenelle shivered at the thought. When Skylark so the look of fear on Arenelle’s face, kindly, he said,”It’s all right. If ya goin’ on a quest I’ll guide ya there. I know where everything is and how to get to it.” Arenelle was reassured. “Skylark, I want to find my long-lost sister Marielle is.”   Skylark seemed to be taken aback. “Marielle-Marielle was lost!” Arenelle sympathetically nodded and patted the lizard. “Let’s go! We are finding her!” Arenelle was glad that someone was not objecting to her determination. “Yep, we are going.” replied Arenelle. And without turning back, the twosome went off on the quest of finding Marielle.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 3- Meet The Valley of the Thinking Brains</p>

<p><strong><em>A</em></strong>renelle did not know where she was, and she hoped that Skylark knew. Skylark was the map of the quest, after all. Then Arenelle decided that she would not ask because Skylark was looking so frightened. Without knowing, Arenelle thought the question. The lizard replied without looking at her. The message read,_We are in the Valley of The Thinking Brains. a place where the mighty Queen Marjorie lives. Maybe we should see the Queen. She might be able to help us. But this may change your mind. If you don&rsquo;t think, she will put you in prison. But that is because she is a type of person called a Thinking Brain. It is like you are a Leaflandian, and I am a Lizalandian. But there is also another group of people who live in this land [called the Noggin] who are the non-thinking brains.Their Queen is mighty Queen Lara. The two groups don&rsquo;t get along but when they meet in the forum, they are separated. There are two parks too. One for Thinking Brains, and one for Non Thinking Brains. So now you get the picture. It is like segregation, except the people are happy about it. Understand? _ Arenelle nodded gratefully, and the two set off to go to the Palace of the Thinking Brains, where mighty Queen Marjorie lived.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 4 -</p>

<p>The 2 friends went along a natural road, with Skylark guiding them. At last they saw a huge, shining palace. Arenelle did not tear her eyes off of it, for she couldn&rsquo;t. Such beautiful lights, they illuminated the whole palace and gave a gorgeous look to it. The two walked together in the night, and they finally met the guards.  &ldquo;You may not enter in thy almighty Queen Marjorie&rsquo;s glamorous palace until you have something in your noggin. &rdquo; Arenelle frantically sent Skylark a message that she did not know what to do. Then Skylark sent back that they would have to lie in order to get through the guards. Arenelle then thought of what she could say.  &ldquo;We do have something in our noggin, if you please, and the only thing in my noggin is coming into thy almighty palace of thy Queen Marjorie. &rdquo; The guards opened the doors, which   to be very heavy, and the two walked into grand palace of Queen Marjorie.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 5 -</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peasants! &rdquo; cried the queen.  &ldquo;Filthy, beastly peasants! &rdquo; Arenelle and Skylark looked at each other for a second, very confused.  &ldquo;Do you have anything in your noggin? &rdquo; Arenelle was ready to answer this.  &ldquo;Yes, we do, thy almighty Queen, thy thought to bow before thy Queen Marjorie. &rdquo; Skylark looked gratefully at Arenelle.  &ldquo;Very well, then. &rdquo; the queen said with a rich british accent.  &ldquo;What about the lizard? &rdquo;  &ldquo;Oh, my majesty, &rdquo; said Arenelle, trembling.  &ldquo;Thy lizard is thinking thy same thought, to bow before thy almighty Queen Marjorie. &rdquo;   Queen Marjorie was smiling with some kind of proud pleasure. Skylark sent Arenelle a message that said:</p>

<p><em>Thanks!</em></p>

<p>Arenelle sent a big grin to Skylark when the Queen wasn&rsquo;t looking. A very suspicious Queen Marjorie interrupted them.  &ldquo;Why are you here? &rdquo;  &ldquo;To find my long-lost sister. &rdquo; Arenelle squeaked out.  &ldquo;And, what are your names? &rdquo;  &ldquo;My name is Arenelle, &rdquo; and Arenelle glanced back at Skylark, &ldquo;and the lizards name is Skylark. He can talk. &rdquo;  &ldquo;Let me hear him say a word or two. &rdquo; said the queen, with that same, rich, british, accent.  &ldquo;Hi, ummm, thy alm-m-mighty Q-queen, ummmm, M-marjorie. &rdquo; Skylark stuttered. Arenelle gave him a look of sympathy to comfort him.  &ldquo;How dare he speak to me that way! &rdquo; bellowed Queen Marjorie.  &ldquo;Well, my Majesty, he has never seen a queen before, therefore, he doesn&rsquo;t know how to act. &ldquo;</p>
