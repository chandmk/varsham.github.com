	<p><strong>Rain Forests: An Introduction</strong></p>

<p>You are in the rainforest. The beautiful green trees tower above you. Beads of sweat form on your face and neck. Your arms are sticky from the large amount of humidity. You are in a rain forest.</p>

<p>Each day is predictable. The rain falls for about 4 inches each day.</p>

<p><strong>People</strong></p>

<p>Rain forest people thrive in the rain forests. They feed on plants from the rain forests, such as berries, plantains, etc.</p>

<p><strong>The Layers of the Rain Forests</strong></p>

<p>You trudge along the moss-covered ground. Suddenly, you see a spider as big as a dinner plate scuttle across the ground. This spider is the biggest one in the world. It is called the goliath (gah-lee-ath) tarantula. The goliath tarantula lives on the forest floor, one of the layers in rain forests. The forest floor is covered with moss, ferns, and creepers. Another animal that lives on the forest floor is the gorilla.</p>

<p>You stand up again after you have recovered from the fright of the goliath tarantula. You look up. You see a monkey with a very long tail swinging from tree to tree up above. You watch in amazement as the monkey deftly and effortlessly hangs and swings. This monkey is called the spider monkey. It is very agile, or nimble. This monkey lives in the understory layer of the forest.</p>

<p>You tilt your head back even farther than before, but all you can see is a large layer of trees. This layer is called the canopy layer. This layer has a lot of leaves, fruits, branches,and flowers. Most of all of the rain forest animals live in the canopy layer.</p>

<p>Suddenly, you hear the squawk of a parrot. There is a layer way above, and it is called the emergent layer. Almost all of the species of birds live in the emergent layer.</p>

<p><strong>Beware!!</strong></p>

<p>You see a little red frog only about the size of your thumb. But don&rsquo;t touch it! In fact, you should stay far away from those killers. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Well, hear this. The poison in the skin of this frog can kill up to 20 people at a time! This frog is called the poison dart frog.</p>

<p>You look cautiously around for king cobras. The poison of one bite of a king cobra can kill an elephant! But luckily you are safe.</p>

<p>Other deadly killers are tigers, caimans, and the green anaconda in the Amazon rain forest. The green anaconda (also the world&rsquo;s heaviest snake) can eat prey about the size of a pig!</p>
