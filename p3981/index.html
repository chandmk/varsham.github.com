    <p>I just had to work. I was a slave. I, Isabella, was a black. I heard Master saying,  &ldquo;Water the plants! Weed the garden! Cook the food! &rdquo; I had to do so many errands! Mother and Father were far away, while Bethany, my older sister, was working here with me. Here, in this horrible place, my sister and I were the cooks. I can&rsquo;t tell you when my birthday is. I don&rsquo;t know my birthday. Don&rsquo;t ask me why.  &ldquo;Bethany, when will we be home? &rdquo;  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sister Isabella. But I will try to find a way.  &rdquo; replied Bethany. After that, I was alert about what I was supposed to do. At night, we waited for mother and father&rsquo;s carriage to come. But after a while, we fell asleep from being tired. Master rolled us in the morning. He wore a glare on his face, and he boomed,  &ldquo;Do your chores, Lazybones! &rdquo; We ran out of bed and strongly and alertly did our chores. At night, we heard a carriage coming. [The reason carriages come is because parents come to pick up their children.] Then we saw Mother and Father coming out! we opened the window, jumped out and closed it. We climbed in and rode all the way home.</p>
