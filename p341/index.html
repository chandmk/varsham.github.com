<h4 id="all_about_the_deconys">All about the Deconys</h4>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Albony. Alobony had 2 sisters. The first sister was named Maria and the second sister was named Alissa. Albony, Alissa, and Maria’s last name was Decony. Albony was 7, Maria was 9, Alissa was 11.</p>

<p>The Decony’s were picking up troubles with their mom: like tattletaling, yelling, calling names, crying too much, and many other things. Albony was more cleverer than her sisters. She could stop a very big fight! But somtimes Albony was part of the fight, and not all the time she could stop a fight. Then she decided to stop herself and her sisters from fighting all the time.</p>

<h3 id="chapter_2">CHAPTER 2</h3>

<h4 id="albony_stops_every_fight">ALBONY STOPS EVERY FIGHT</h4>

<p>Albony decided to make a gift for herself and her sisters. Well,it was almost April, which is Easter. Next, Albony gathered her things to make the gift. Her matirials were, plastic, leather, and an old shirt. First Albony decided to make a house. First, she used plastic to make the roof of the house, next she used the left over plastic and made the walls, then she decided to make furniture inside so the house won’t be boring. Then she used alot of plastic to make the bed and for the sheet and blanket of the bed she used the old shirt. Since she had nothing to do with the house she made a 3 dimentional doll and put it in the house and for other furniture for the house she used plastic. She made 2 other houses with the same material for her other two sisters. On Easter she gave the gifts with a card saying:</p>

<h6 id="this_is_a_gift_for_you_sister_if_you_want_to_open_it_you_can_i_hope_you_will_like_my_gift">This is a gift for you sister. If you want to open it, you can. I hope you will like my gift.</h6>

<p>Then Albony gave the gift to her sisters. Her sisters were suprised when they saw it and they played with it all the time! They thanked her and they stopped fights all the time!</p>

<h3 id="chapter_3">CHAPTER 3</h3>
