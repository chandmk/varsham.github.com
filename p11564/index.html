    <p>Well, what is it? The Transatlantic slave trade occurred during the 15th century, around 1650. What do you think when you hear the word  &ldquo;slave &ldquo;?</p>

<p>You might be thinking of deadly diseases, forced labor, and just brutal conditions in general. This was all true for the slaves who were forced to work during the Transatlantic slave trade, but the Africans, the people who actually started the trade, did not mean for it to turn out that way. Instead, they meant for the slave trade to be a kind act of servitude, until the Europeans came and messed it all up.</p>

<p>Even though Europe caused a lot of damage, they were only junior partners with Africa during the slave trade. Why? Well, they had dangerous winds the smashed their boats against rocks, and so, they could not travel to West Africa, where all the slave trade was beginning. At least, not as easily. But why did they want to be part of the slave trade? Well, the answer to that is &hellip;imperialism!</p>

<p>Imperialism is when a country, or in this case, Europe, tries to expand its power by gaining land, power, and wealth.  Also, Europe, along with Portugal, was crazy for sugar. They wanted a boat route East, where all the good stuff, like spices and silk, were. But, to create sugar, it&rsquo;s back-breaking work. So, Europe wanted sugar, so what was available and  _also _ could get them their sugar? The slaves. This was where Europe went a little crazy. The  &ldquo;masters &ldquo;, or the people who owned slaves, treated the slaves as if they were not people. Instead, the masters treated them like their own property, and the slaves&rsquo; rights were stripped. On the other hand, slaves in Africa at least had some rights. When they had a child, that child was not always born into slavery. But, when a child of a slave was born, the child could be born in slavery, and many slaves had no hope of a better future.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk more about imperialism, since it played a huge role in the Transatlantic slave trade. They were motives for slave trade, and these specific motives included ideologism, exploration, religion, and economics.</p>

<p>Ideologism was the motive that  promoted  &ldquo;white people &ldquo;, saying that the  &ldquo;white race &rdquo; was superior over the  &ldquo;black race &ldquo;. Exploration was the motive that promoted, well, exploration. People from Europe wanted more land, so by exploring, they could claim asylum, or gain, land that they discovered. Next, the motive for religion promoted Christians, working as missionaries, to spread Christianity to people. Lastly, there was economics. This promoted doing things just to get money.</p>

<p>These motives were very important, because it defined why the Europeans did what they did.</p>

<p>Back to the slave trade. The slaves did not want to be slaves, that much was for sure. They revolted, but the sad part was that the Europeans, armed with better weapons, which included guns, always won. But there was one bloody revolt, and the leader of it was Nat Turner.</p>

<p>Nat Turner had visions before he conducted the revolt - he dreamed of God telling him to wait for a sign, and when the sign came, Nat Turner should attack the owners that were treating them like they were property, and not people. Nat Turner obeyed, and his revolt was a success, although, afterwards, lives for slaves got harder. Nat Turner, along with his many followers during the revolt, were captured and executed.</p>

<p>After reading all this, you might think that slavery is over now. But that&rsquo;s not true - in fact, the United States still has a lot of slaves working in modern slavery. Slavery is an ideological problem that must be solved, because no one deserves to live the way the slaves did - and still do.</p>
