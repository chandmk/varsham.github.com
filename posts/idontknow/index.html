	<p>Outline: Must answer the question: Was the French Revolution for the better, or for worse?</p>

<p>Had the French Revolution not occurred, many important changes would not have been made to the general state of France. Although it involved the brutal murder of hundreds of nobles, the reason being their unfortunate aristocratic name, it also broke down feudalism, which had plagued the country for many centuries. In fact, the massacre of the aristocrats was because of feudalism: The people who were further down the deadly feudalism ladder were not obliged to continue being forced to labor for the &ldquo;aristos&rdquo;. In fact, the aristocrats, which included the king and the queen, the nobles, and the knights - to some extent - were not required to pay taxes. On the other hand, the serfs and the peasants, which were the lowest castes of people in the feudal system, were demanded outrageous taxes that depleted them to such a degree that they constantly teetered on the brink of starvation. At last, it became widely of the opinion of the commons that a revolt against the aristocrats had to occur. It was the first step to a long and brutal journey that we now call the French Revolution.</p>
