	<p>Once there lived a poor maiden named Gardeneeka. She set out trying to sell her most beautiful handkerchiefs, but no one bought them. Finally, one little girl pulled her mother towards the handmade handkerchiefs. Gardeneeka looked at the young girl&rsquo;s mother with hopeful eyes, but the mother refused to buy the kerchiefs. So, the little girl&rsquo;s mother angrily talked to her daughter about the kerchiefs while walking away. Gardeneeka hoped and hoped, but no one came to buy to the kerchiefs. She wrote down a list of ideas and chose the best one. She steadily began packaging. The next morning, the kerchiefs were packed in silver boxes. Then, the little girl came back with her mother. The mother paid for the boxes. Then, people started coming to buy these handkerchiefs with their rich containers. When she was out of handkerchiefs, she was wealthier than before. Now, Gardeneeka knows that Gittolians love silver.</p>
