    <p>I put my head down as my test time went on. It was the hardest test any 4th grader could understand.   I wish I had studied. I just could not remember what this 4th grade math was. Some pain was in my bones, and I could not bear it.  &ldquo;Test time is over! Put down your folders! Time for lunch! &rdquo;   said my teacher.  &ldquo;Lucky classmates! &rdquo; I thought. Every other 4th grader quickly from their seats and turned in their papers. Everyone but me.    &ldquo;Cassie? Are you okay?  &rdquo; It was the soft voice of my teacher.  &ldquo;No, &rdquo; I muttered.    &ldquo;I am sorry for that. But that shouldn&rsquo;t stop you from your test, don&rsquo;t you think?  &rdquo; I quietly scowled.    &ldquo;Why do 4th graders get the MSA? I already had it last year! &rdquo; I wailed.    &ldquo;You are a responsible 4th grader, and you should be happy with what you have. &rdquo; The teacher was beginning to get cross. My eyes filled with tears that dropped on my horrible test. I slowly trudged   to the TURN &#8212; IN   box and weakly put the test paper in the box.   Then, the teacher gave me permission to go to the nurse&rsquo;s room. I walked to the nurse&rsquo;s room. She checked my temperature which was 1.08 degrees.  &ldquo;You have high fever! &rdquo; She said. The nurse immediatley   called my mom and I was brought home. I dreamed about that nightmare giving test during my extra rest time. But I twisted and turned in the extra sleep. I did not feel good at all. After a small dinner, I went to bed that night with the same, restless sleep. During the night, my mom gave me some medicine. Also, I saw my mom hovering over me when I was awake. The next day, I stayed at home. My mom checked my temperature Which was now 1.00. Well, I got a little better, at least. The next day, I had the symptoms. Then after that, I was 98 degrees. So I went to school late. The test time was over, but I had to finish my test after math. I did it very well and calm. A week later, the test scores came. I was the only one who got 100%! I happily skipped to the bus and told my mom. Yesssss!</p>
