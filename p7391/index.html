	<p>My home. Denmark. A village of beauty. The sky always had that forget-me-not blue in the mornings. The sun glowed bright yellow. In the night-times, there was a beautiful blackish bluish color in the dark sky. The stars twinkled like far away lanterns, and the moon glowed a gray color, filled with sweetness of no other kind. In the mornings, the morning dew sparkled on the bright green grass. A young tree in front our house had birds chirping all over it in their nests. I then heard the sound of airplanes. There were so many airplanes that I couldn&rsquo;t even see the morning sun. Then I saw that mark - the swastika. The swastika is a symbol that represents the Nazi soldiers. I rushed inside. I helped Mamma set up blackout curtains so the Nazis wouldn&rsquo;t see us. The Nazi&rsquo;s bulky boots produced a loud sound. I covered my ears. That sound was too terrible to hear. Finally the soldiers passed our house. I sighed in relief. But, I did know that they would be in Denmark for a long time.</p>

<p>The next morning, Mamma&rsquo;s placed the cross around my neck. I needed that cross because the Nazis hated Jews. They would harm me if they knew that I was a Jew. The cross was disguising me as a Christian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma! I don&rsquo;t want to go to school! &rdquo; I said</p>

<p>But Mamma sent me out the door nevertheless of my words. When I was outside, I tried not to notice the Nazis. I heaved my heavy backpack onto my shoulders. Suddenly a bunch of Nazis stepped in front of me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you have in there, little girl? &ldquo;</p>

<p>Their words repeated over and over in my mind. One Nazi gave a gesture that I take off my backpack. I slowly took the backpack off my shoulders. With a laugh that made me shudder, he took the backpack. That Nazi passed it to another Nazi, whom, with a glide of his fingers, opened the backpack. I looked away. When I looked at that scene, my eyes drew me to their black eyes. That reminded me of cruelty, suffering, and despair.</p>

<p>The soldier shoved the backpack towards me, laughing a cruel, evil laugh.</p>

<p>I finally came into school. I looked around as I came into the hall. I saw a horrible sight. Izzy (As everyone called him), the school janitor was Jewish. The Nazis were dragging him away by his wrists. An ache passed through me.</p>

<p>Why Jews?</p>

<p>That was not fair. After that, school was fun when I wasn&rsquo;t in the halls. Whenever I was in the halls, I remembered Izzy and the Nazis. I was afraid I would see it again, so I looked down in the halls. When I got home, I finished my homework. Then, I heard a knock on the door. I went downstairs and opened the door. I was surprised at who stood before me. A Jewish man stood, bedraggled at the door!</p>

<p>I smiled at the man and said,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get my mother. You can come inside.  &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much,  &rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>I brought my mother to the man.  &ldquo;You may tell your story,  &rdquo; said my mother.</p>

<p>With that, the man launched into a long explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were happy Jews living in a proper home. It was warm and cozy, until I heard the Nazis.  &ldquo;</p>

<p>The man stopped, and then went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Nazis pushed the door down, and started tearing down everything. All we could do was stand and watch in horror.  &ldquo;</p>

<p>I could tell that Mama was moved by the man&rsquo;s sad story.  &ldquo;You may stay with us,  &rdquo; she said softly.</p>

<p>So that is how we saved a Jewish man from being locked up in a concentration camp. The next day, we learned that the Jewish man&rsquo;s name was Gideon. Gideon never pushed the black out curtains off the windows, knowing the Nazis would see him if he did so.</p>

<p>The next day, I went to school with the same Christian cross pressed to my chest. I looked down the whole day, unless my teacher was talking, because I did not want to see any more Jewish people being dragged away. Finally, I got home. I greeted Gideon, and then I greeted Mama. I could not smile at Mama, so I pasted a strained smile on my face in front of her.</p>

<p>I sat down and tried to finish my homework, but I couldn&rsquo;t concentrate. So, I just lazily stood up and flopped on my pillow. I then crawled to the front of the bed and pulled up the covers. I stared up at the white ceiling in my room. It was full of a strange kind of loneliness &hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Child, wake up!  &ldquo;</p>

<p>I woke up with a start. I saw Mamma leaning over me. When I finally rested my eyes on her grey ones, she smiled. I suddenly remembered everything that I had to do. I jumped out of bed and got ready just in time for school. I waved back at Mamma as I walked to school. The Nazis did not bother me. I felt better at school. I did not see the Nazis anywhere there. My teacher did not give much homework because it was a Friday. She gently scolded me for not finishing my homework. The school day ended. I went to my house. When I opened the unlocked door, I saw Mamma and Gideon with a suitcase. Mamma handed me a fully packed suitcase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving here, child. I packed this for you.  &ldquo;</p>

<p>I took the suitcase from Mamma and followed her out, with Gideon trailing behind. It was a little red suitcase, hard and leathery. The suitcase held many items. Mamma did not tell me where we were going, but if we ever come back I imagine that the Nazis will be gone. Someday, my wish will come true. I will have hope. Someday.</p>
