    <p>Hello, I am the knight. A boy knight. I have the handsome head of a war horse. I am as strong as those knights that ride on those war horses. I can withstand anyone that traverses my path. My cousin Pawna, is the youngest of all. I don&rsquo;t really talk with any of her 6 siblings and their mother, and so has the others. The pawns look like their mother. Bishoppa the bishop, on the other hand, is my smart, kind, cousin. I always like to shuffle to his spot in the bag to talk to him. The queen is the leader. The king is a valiant, immortal warrior that is now commander. But the reason why we have to protect him in the game is because he is very busy. He has to make the next game&rsquo;s list, and the schedules, the strategy, manage the kingdom, and everything!</p>

<p>I have a brother. Older brother. His name is Knightae. [Ny-tay]He is always is nice to me around any of the chess pieces or the queen, but he isn&rsquo;t nice at all to me when we are alone. But that is because I stayed in games longer than him, and he is jealous. My name is Knighta.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knighta, my boy, time to play!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes Queen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I rush out and get to my place. I move in a strange way. I move in an L shape.</p>

<p>The queen hands me a small list of who was going first. I show it to everyone. Pawna is going first. She takes 2 feeble steps forward. A black pawn moves in front of her. I can see Pawna cry silently in fear. I look down at the list. I was not next but I went anyway. The queen flashes me an angry look. I move to the place where the black knight is standing. Next move, he would be out unless he doesn&rsquo;t move. As I corner him, I say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go close to my youngest cousin.&rdquo; The knight was rigid with fear. Then, a black pawn comes forward. I trap that black pawn the same way I did with the knight. Oops. My big mistake. He could get me out. But he is so rigid with fear, he doesn&rsquo;t even think of coming to capture me.   Our pawn moves forward one space. I capture the knight. Now I wait for the black. The bishop moves in a way that in the next move I will be out. I move away and corner the bishop the same way he did to me. Another of our pawns moves forward. I capture the bishop. So this happens again and again until I reach the black king. Checkmate. The white team cheers. I myself cheer. Finally I am led back into my room. The queen asks to see me. She scolds me. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t let the other players play!&rdquo; she says. She shouts herself hoarse until she lets me to leave. Pawna hugs me and says thank you. I just smile back at her and hug her back. We are packed up into a dark bag in a dark box. Bye!</p>
