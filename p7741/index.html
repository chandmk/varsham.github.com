	<p>I jumped for joy when I heard that I would be seeing the middle school play. My sister was not as excited as me, nor my mother. We would be seeing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, a story which I have read for hours for my passion for it was strong. I used to read it so many times, although it was quite a large book.</p>

<p>Finally, I steeped out of the car, releived for the ride seemed to take long.</p>

<p>I ran ahead of my mother and my middle-school sister, who were talking. I finally resisted the urge to open the heavy double doors and set foot inside the cool lobby and sauntered beside my sister. Although my legs were begging to run ahead, I didn’t want to get lost in the large middle school.</p>

<p>As soon as the commotion about the seats settled, the lights dimmed. I kept asking my mother when It would start, but she always answered,”Just wait, Varsha.”</p>

<p>I waited for a long time until the lights above the small stage beightened. I leaned my head against my chair and glued my eyes to the middle of the stage.</p>

<p>Then, the magic began to appear on the stage.</p>
