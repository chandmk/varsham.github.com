	<p>Anna went over to the stump where the tree was cut. Anna planted a tree which would grow in a long time. Anna was 6 now, when Anna was 16, Anna&rsquo;s tree was fully grown! Sixteen year old Anna climbed up her tree. she saw a tiny girl with wings.  &ldquo;Hi! My name is Caroline! We saw you plant us a new home, this tree. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I j-j-just wanted to replace th-th-the old tree that-t-t was c-c-c-cut down. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need to be afraid. We just thank you. But if you want, you can be an ice fairy. We have none in our land. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Caroline! I would not refuse! I can come on Saturdays and Sundays! &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just what we need. But you need to go to fairy school. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will I learn there? &rdquo; asked Anna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will learn the magic of ice fairies. Also, I will shrink you to be like us on Saturday fairy school. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will come. My name is Anna. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bye Anna! &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bye Caroline! &ldquo;</p>

<p>Anna happily skipped home, very EXCITED TO GO TO FAIRY SCHOOL!</p>
