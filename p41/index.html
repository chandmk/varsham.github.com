    <p>There were happy insects living in the tall grass but people were lawn mowing their grass homes! So the leader of the group went to Mary. The leader of the group was Banic. He asked if Mary could help him. Mary said my only choice is to make very hard plastic tall grass, but ah! bu Ah!, Go on, Go on said Banic.</p>

<p>I need to check in online. But the computer knows nothing. Oh! no, cried Banic. So he went to Ave. He asked Ave if he could help.</p>

<p>Ave said my only choice is to sting people. But we will die after we sting.</p>

<p>Then Banic went to Rashy. Hey Rashy can you give rashes to the people? No, that will hurt them and I have poisioness rash. But Banic started to argue. Okay fine I will rash the humans, he went and rashed the humans and after all they always had homes and food.</p>
