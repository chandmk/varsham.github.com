    <p>Anna climbed up the trees she had met last time. It was the sessions of Fairy School. When Anna climbed up, she saw that she was shrinking! When she was her tiny size, she had wings and a wand! She also had a bracelet made out of snow did not hurt her hands. The tip of her wand was a snowflake. Then Caroline came with some other fairies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Savannah the heat fairy, Willow the weather fairy, Dinah the draw fairy, Alice the animal fairy, Felicity the flower fairy, and Hannah the happy fairy. &ldquo;</p>

<p>There were not a lot of fairies. They all waved hi. In a blinding flash of light, she was in a room. Felicity was there, too. The teacher was beautiful. She had flowers in her hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi! I am Felicity the flower fairy. I am in training too. Look, isn&rsquo;t the teacher pretty? &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, &rdquo; replied Anna.</p>

<p>So they learned magic according to what kind of fairy they were. So every Saturday and Sunday, they learned all the magic.</p>
