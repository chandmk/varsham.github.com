	<p>Yeah, right. Moving. Yep. But I, Ella, am so not moving. I don&rsquo;t care if my family goes. I just don&rsquo;t want to go. Dad was upset that mom did not want him to have a job in Maryland [We live in Brazil], so dad disappeared. Dad&rsquo;s disappearance made mom cry, so she finally agreed. Mom couldn&rsquo;t protest now. So I, a 3rd grader, feels envied about the people who get to stay in Brazil. This reminds me of Strider and Wonder, if you have read it. The boys in both books have problems. At night, I fell asleep thinking about these books.</p>

<p>Well, there are 21 days of school, and the first day of summer, I am moving. Waiting. Waiting. Saying bye. Moving. all these words whirled around my head. 21 days later &hellip; &hellip;..  &ldquo;Come on! Ella! Hurry! We need to catch the plane! &rdquo; We went on the plane. 9 hours of plane sickness. Ugh. After those tiring 9 hours, we climbed off the plane. We moved into an apartment. After a summer of half sulking and half playing, I went on this bus. When I stepped off, I met my teacher, Mrs.Rye. At the beginning, we wrote our names on our name card necklaces.  &ldquo;Class, we will ban running in class, hitting, and talking while I am talking. Any questions? &rdquo; I feebly raised my hand. I was the only person to raise my hand!  &ldquo;Ella. &rdquo;  &ldquo;What-t-t-t d-d-does b-b-ban m-mean-n-n-n? &rdquo; Some people giggled. I felt my face turn hot.  &ldquo;Alex, don&rsquo;t laugh at people who don&rsquo;t know what you know. &rdquo; Then Mrs.Rye turned to me.  &ldquo;Ban means to not allow. Also, don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask words that you don&rsquo;t know. &rdquo; Under Mrs.Rye&rsquo;s comfort, I never was afraid to ask a word.</p>
