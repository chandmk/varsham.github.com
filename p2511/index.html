	<p>Claude strode back and forth, showing that he was bored. Claude was a detective. Suddenly Claude heard somebody shouting and calling his name. He followed the voice to Anetta, his neighbor. Claude saw that Anetta was looking tensed.  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong Anetta? &rdquo; Claude asked. Where was it? Where was it?  &ldquo;My camp medal was stolen! &rdquo; Anetta shrieked. Claude thought for a moment. Why would someone take someone else&rsquo;s medal? He is asking to himself. &ldquo; Where was the medal at first? &rdquo; Claude asked. It was right here! said Anetta pointed in her garage at a box beside her shoe rack. Claude walked in to Anetta&rsquo;s garage he opened the box but the medal was gone.</p>

<p>Claude gasped! He could not believe it.  &ldquo;Anetta, &rdquo; Claude called her. What color was the medal? Was there any writing on it? What is the shape of the medal? Just give me the photo of the medal. That would be benefit to solve the mystery. So, then Anetta pulled out a photo from her pocket. She gave the photo to Claude. Claude looked at the picture, it was a silver medal. Anetta&rsquo;s name was written on the medal with gold. The medal was big and thick base. Claude asked, &ldquo;Can I borrow this photo? &ldquo;.  &ldquo;Yes &rdquo; Anetta replied. Claude ran all the way home. Claude wrote on a piece paper, Dear mom,</p>

<p>I am on a case of stolen medal. I will be back.</p>

<p>Love</p>

<p>Claude Piper</p>

<p>The next morning Claude changed his clothes and ran down to have breakfast. His mother and father went to work. While Claude was eating breakfast, he saw two medal on his fireplace mantle. Then Claude realized Anetta left her medal at his home, when she came over for a play date. Claude took the medal of Anetta and headed out to Anetta&rsquo;s home. He told Anetta that she forgot to take her she brought at the play date few days before. Anetta took the medal and clutched it. This is very special to me, Anetta said. Anetta thanked Claude.</p>
