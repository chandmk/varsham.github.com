    <p>The Capture is a very intense book. It&rsquo;s about family of owls, but the older brother of this family, Kludd, does not like Soren or Eglantine, his two younger siblings. So, Kludd shoves Soren out of his nest, and Soren gets  &ldquo;snatched &rdquo; by St. Aegolius, orphanage, a place where questions are not allowed, and a place where owls get snatched to. There, the patrol is all  &ldquo;moon-blinked &ldquo;, or in other words, the patrol of St. Aegolius are all brain-washed. Gylfie, a friend that Soren makes in the orphanage, along with Soren, quickly think up a plan that will keep them from becoming the mindless robots that the other moon-blinked owls have become. Later, they find the true brutality of the staff there, and it is then evident that they will not be able to resist the moon-blinking any longer, so they have to escape. They find another owl who has not been moon-blinked, and the three work together to save the eggs that are being snatched to be taken to St. Aegolius. But, the other owl, named Hortense, gets discovered, and Gylfie and Soren, find another owl named Grimble, who resisted moon-blinking as well. From Grimble, Soren and Gylfie learn how to fly earlier than their flying feathers had come in, and they fly away just as Spoorn, one of the moon-blinked staff, kills Grimble, and Gylfie and Soren are free. They meet a burrowing owl named Digger, and two eagles named Zan and Streak. Zan&rsquo;s tongue was ripped out because he helped Hortense save the eggs and was discovered. At last, when searching the snatched ones&rsquo; home, and finding none of their family, they decide to venture to Ga&rsquo;hoole, a mystical tree in the middle of an island.</p>

<p>I liked The Capture because it revealed so many surprises. For example, I did not know that Kludd had that much hatred to be able to shove Soren off the nest. Also, Soren seemed meek at first, but when he got older, he showed his true colors.</p>

<p>The Capture was a great book!</p>
