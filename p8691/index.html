	<p>I think that unhealthy school lunches should not be allowed because they can cause diabetes. This disease does not have cure and it is developed by obesity. Obesity is developed from the eating of fried or oily foods, such as the foods in Haley&rsquo;s cafeteria. Haley is a person who has a cafeteria that serves unhealthy lunches. According to the article I read, Haley&rsquo;s lunch menu for that day was french fries, hot dogs, and pizza. These types of foods are fried, and they have too much fat in them. Theses kinds of foods can cause obesity, and from obesity, it can cause diabetes.</p>

<p>About 20 years ago, a child&rsquo;s chance of getting obesity was 6.5 percent. Now that chance of diabetes has increased by 8.5 percent! Just think of it! Now the chance of diabetes is 15 percent! That is a lot!</p>

<p>Since so many problems could occur in children, and since these kinds of foods can cause diabetes, I don&rsquo;t think that the authorities should allow unhealthy foods in cafeterias.</p>
