    <p>I picked up the dolphin and shrunk. Then I climbed inside. I climbed through the crack I had made the day before. It was summer in Ireland, and I set off to find Gwendolyne. But something blocked me and made me tumble into the crack. Scratches came on my arms, and oh! Were they painful! I scooted to the back of the dolphin. Finally, the black thing went away from the crack. I climbed out, and the black thing came charging at me! I figured out that the  &ldquo;black thing &rdquo; was a witch! I remembered the spell to make the witch disappear, and yelled,  &ldquo;ADIA!GADIA!SADIE!SADIE!TAMIA! &rdquo; The witch disappeared, and I found out that my wings were wounded. I fell to the ground. Then Gwendolyne rushed me to the wingologist. The wing doctor, to be clear. I woke up. My bleeding scratches were bandaged. My wing was so active. I flew out of the hospital with Gwendolyne. Then, I drank hot chocolate while watching the movie, The Lion King. That is one of my favorite movies. Then, I climbed in the dolphin. I waited 5 minutes, then I was home. I climbed out of the crack and grew taller. The bandages were still there. I went upstairs the way so my mom would not see me. You know how mothers are. They don&rsquo;t like it if you tell them lies. Upstairs, I carefully peeled off the bandages. The wounds were gone. This adventure might have been short, but a lot of things happened. I wrote in my diary. Like I always do.</p>
