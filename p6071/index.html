	<p>My family and I were coming back from Back to School Night.I happily skipped ahead of them. I ran to the door and waited for them. Finally, my smiling parents came to the door and unlocked it. I ran to the room where the sofas were and ran back into the front door room to pull them in. But they weren&rsquo;t there.</p>

<p>I ran upstairs and checked - They weren&rsquo;t there. As I helplessly looked all over the room, I didn&rsquo;t notice 2 vampires, coming silently behind until I whirled around. Now the vampire&rsquo;s strides were getting faster. I pressed myself hard against the wall.</p>

<p>Suddenly, rainbows formed around me. I couldn&rsquo;t clarify of what I was really seeing. My vision finally cleared. But then, I was spinning like a tornado.</p>

<p>I could hear the whispery voices of the 2 monsters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve wanted you all these years and we got you! &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>NOOOOOO! &ldquo;</strong></p>

<p>But a beautiful light behind me comforted me as I turned around. It was a beautiful fairy princess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send them out of this world! &rdquo; she said. Then she turned to me.  &ldquo;Your parents were captured by the vampires. &rdquo; She stepped aside.</p>

<p>My mother and my father were there! I ran to them. Thank you, fairy princess!</p>
