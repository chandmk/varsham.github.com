    <p>Anna and Bethany climbed the tree and saw Caroline. Caroline warmly greeted them as they became Ice fairies. Bethany did not ask as many questions as her first time.  &ldquo;Anna, would you teach Bethany the magic? Bethany, do not ask so many questions. Anna will teach you everything you need to learn. &rdquo; said Caroline. Anna told her wand to take them to Fairy School. At last, they were at Fairy School. It seemed that Bethany was fascinated by the room because of the surprised look on her face. The room had wallpaper with roses on it, and the window sill had flowers decorating it. This room was the same room that Anna learned in. Anna taught Bethany all of the Ice Fairy magic. At the end of class, Bethany knew everything and practiced it with her sister, Anna.</p>
