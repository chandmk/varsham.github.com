	<p>One day there was a sailor, who lived far away, in the land of Tanzeen. He mostly went on a boat called Seaville. The ocean he went was called The Everest Sea. His name was Collin Major. His family was very poor. He tried to sell Everest Sea’s fish, but all he caught was stinky fish. Collin knew he had to help him and his sea friends to get a lot of money.He knew he had to make better fish or make better choices.So he went to his home and told April Major his wife, to come with him on his ship.He told his daughters also to come on his ship, which were Isabella, and Heather.He and his sea friends didn’t have much strength because they hadn’t ate for days.They caught some pines and skillets which were very stinky fish.The Everest Sea had only those two stinky fish.Collin had to share ideas about how to help with his friends and family.Then , April asked,in a angry voice, “Why have you brought us here Collin?”</p>

<p>“To share ideas about how we can make the pines and skillets better.” replied Collin.”Then let’s do it now.” said April Major.” Okay then, you annoying April!” shouted Collin. ” Fine.” said April, about to cry.Collin and his friends had a meeting about the stinky fish for a minute.Then Collin smiled at April and said sweetly “My dear wife we -….. …..” He stopped because Isabella and Heather said “Let’s let the orca sharks eat the stinky fish and let’s go to another ocean!”Oh yes! SHE IS VERY VERY VERY WISE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” yelled Collin and his sea friends. So when they did the plan Collin got so so so so so so so rich. Then the family was better just, because of, Isabella and Heather.</p>
